	abstract = {Characterizing marine phytoplankton community variability is crucial to designing sampling strategies and interpreting time series. Satellite remote sensing, microscopy sampling, and ﬂow through imaging systems have widely different resolutions: from weekly or monthly with microscopy sampling to daily when no cloud cover or glint is present with polar-orbiting satellites, and hourly for autonomous imaging instruments. To improve our understanding of data robustness against sampling resolution at different taxonomic levels, we analyze 2 yr of data from an Imaging FlowCytobot with hourly resolution and resample it to daily, satellite-temporal, and weekly microscopy sampling resolution. We show that weekly and satellite-temporal resolutions are sufﬁcient to resolve general community composition but that the randomness of satellite-temporal resolution can result in overrepresenting or underrepresenting certain categories. While the yearly phytoplankton biomass bloom is detected in late winter by all four resolutions, category-speciﬁc yearly blooms are generally consistent in timing but often underestimated or missed by the weekly and satellite-temporal resolutions, introducing a bias in year-to-year comparisons. A minimum of biweekly sampling, particularly during known bloom periods, would lower the bias in such categories. Similarly, sampling time should be considered as daily variations are categoryspeciﬁc. Overall, morning and low tide sampling tended to have higher biomass. We provide tables for categories detected by the IFCB in Narragansett Bay with their major bloom characteristics and recorded daily variability to inform future sampling designs. These results provide tools to interpret past and future time series, including possible detection of speciﬁc taxonomic groups with targeted satellite algorithms.},

          , 
            Marine microbial communities sustain ocean food webs and mediate global elemental cycles. These communities will change with climate; these changes can be gradual or foreseeable but likely have much more substantial consequences when sudden and unpredictable. In a complex virtual marine microbial ecosystem, we find that climate change–driven shifts over the 21st century are often abrupt, large in amplitude and extent, and unpredictable using standard early warning signals. Phytoplankton with unique resource needs, especially fast-growing species such as diatoms, are more prone to abrupt shifts. Abrupt shifts in biomass, productivity, and community structure are concentrated in Atlantic and Pacific subtropics. Abrupt changes in environmental variables such as temperature and nutrients rarely precede these ecosystem shifts, indicating that rapid community restructuring can occur in response to gradual environmental changes, particularly in nutrient supply rate ratios.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Photosynthetic CO2 uptake by oceanic phytoplankton and subsequent export of particulate organic carbon (POC) to the ocean interior comprises a globally significant biological carbon pump, controlled in part by the composition of the planktonic community. The strength and efficiency of this pump depends upon the balance of particle production in the euphotic zone and remineralization of those particles in the mesopelagic (defined here as depths between 150 and 300 m), but how these processes respond to climate-driven changes in the physical environment is not completely understood. In the Sargasso Sea, from {\textasciitilde}1996–2007, we have observed a decade-long {\textgreater}50\% increase in euphotic zone integrated autotrophic biomass (estimated from chlorophyll TChl-α), prokaryotic phytoplankton, primary production and shallow (150 m) POC export coinciding with a shift in the mean phase of the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) from consistently positive to neutral but variable. During this same period mesopelagic POC flux attenuation has doubled such that carbon sequestration below 300 m, the maximum winter/spring ventilation depth, has not changed. The increased mesopelagic POC attenuation appears mediated by changes in plankton community composition and metabolic activity in both the euphotic and mesopelagic zones. These changes are counter to extant hypotheses regarding inter-relationships between phytoplankton community composition, productivity and carbon export, and have significant impacts on how the Sargasso Sea ecosystem, at least, is modeled. Moreover, these time-series observations suggest that processes in the euphotic zone and mesopelagic are tightly coupled and should be considered together in future research.},

Every 15 days, water samples were obtained at depths of 1 and 20 m using Van Dorn bottles (2.5 L). 1324 analyses and temperature records were taken. Based on the annual concentration of Chl. a, three groups of years were identified: 2002 to 2004, with Chl. a between 2.60 and 3.09 mg/m3 ; 2005 to 2013 and 2018, with Chl. a between 0.59 and 2.28 mg/m3 ; and 2014 to 2017, with values between 3.13 and 3.37 mg/m3. Chl. a values were greater at a 20 m depth and during upwelling periods, except in 2013 and 2018. The highest values of Chl. a coincide with the largest sardine catches, and the lowest concentrations converge with the sardine crisis. Between 2002 and 2004, the lowest average temperatures (24.65 to 25.33 °C) were reported and the maximum sardine catches occurred. From 2005 to 2017, the average temperature increased from 26.22 to 27.54 °C, and the highest values were reported in 2016 and 2017 with a modest recovery of fishing. From 2003-2004 and until 2018, the temperature increased by nearly 2 °C. When the temperature rose from 25 °C, the Chl. a has a significant decrease. The sardine catch had a moderate correlation with the Chl. a concentration and a negative correlation with temperature. Possible causes of the sardine crisis are mentioned in this work.},

The sardine eggs deviate from the indicated trend, since they were more abundant in years 2002-2004 and 2014-2016 and were lower in density between 2005 and 2013. This trend was more notable in its representation (\%) in mesozooplankton. Due to the greater abundance of 13 zooplankton groups and their total density, it is confirmed that a regime shift occurred affecting ecosystem services such as sardine fishing, generating an approximately 10-year long crisis.},

Eutreptiella species exhibit high phenotypic plasticity, enabling adaptation to various environmental conditions, from nutrient-rich waters to high-salinity conditions. They play a crucial role in primary production and nutrient cycling in marine ecosystems. Genetic and transcriptomic studies have revealed their complex regulatory mechanisms and potential for biofuel and nutraceutical production. Eutreptiella blooms significantly impact local ecosystems, influencing nutrient availability and community dynamics. Additionally, interactions with associated bacteria enhance their growth and metabolic capabilities. The genus shows substantial genetic variability, suggesting potential misidentifications or a polyphyletic nature. Further comprehensive studies are needed to clarify their taxonomy and evolutionary relationships.

The temporal dynamics of the total diatom ﬂux mainly reﬂect seasonal, trade wind-driven changes in surface hydrographic conditions, including changes associated with the El Nin˜ o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Highest diatom ﬂuxes (41.8 107 valves m 2 d 1) coincided with the upwelling season in boreal winters 1997 and 1999. Changes in the composition of the diverse diatom community reﬂect variations in hydrographic and atmospheric conditions, as well as nutrient availability. Cyclotella litoralis, a neritic diatom typical of nutrient-rich waters, along with resting spores of several Chaetoceros spp., dominate during periods of high diatom ﬂux, following trade wind-driven upwelling. During the boreal summers of 1997 and 1999, nutrient-depleted surface waters resulted in low diatom ﬂuxes (o5.2 106 valves m 2 d 1). The seasonal pattern of high diatom production was altered from July 1997 through April 1998, when the ENSO affected the Caribbean Sea. The occurrence of ENSO during boreal winter 1997–1998 caused a major change in the qualitative composition of the diatom assemblage: the highly diverse diatom assemblage was composed of a mixture of pelagic (Nitzschia bicapitata, Thalassionema nitzschioides var. inﬂata, T. nitzschioides var. parva, Azpeitia tabularis) and coastal species (C. litoralis, resting spores of Chaetoceros, T. nitzschioides var. nitzschioides). The simultaneous occurrence of neritic and openocean diatoms during boreal summers reﬂects the fact that the Cariaco Basin is inﬂuenced by both offshore and coastal waters, with considerable short-term variability in hydrographic conditions and nutrient availability.},

	abstract = {Bio-optical properties of marine waters of the Cariaco Basin (southeastern Caribbean Sea) were assessed monthly between 1995 and 2005 as part of the CARIACO Ocean Time Series program. Temporal changes in light quality and penetration were caused by seasonal variation in the concentration of three major optical constituents, namely phytoplankton, detrital particles, and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). All constituents showed higher absorption coefﬁcients during the upwelling season (January–May) compared to the rainy season (June–November). Both the absorption coefﬁcient due to CDOM (ag(440)) and due to phytoplankton (aph(440)) had similar contributions to total absorption of light during the upwelling season (aph(440) ¼0.062 7 0.042 m 1, ag(440) ¼ 0.065 7 0.047 m 1). In contrast, ag(440) dominated light absorption during the rainy season (aph(440) ¼ 0.017 7 0.011 m 1, ag(440) ¼ 0.057 7 0.031). This led to an overestimate in SeaWiFS-derived chlorophyll concentrations during the rainy season, of between 7\% and 45\%. The detrital component, ad(440), typically showed the smallest contribution (ad(440) ¼ 0.021 7 0.014 m 1 during upwelling and 0.007 7 0.001 m 1 during the rainy season). There was no clear relationship between the various optically active components in time. During the upwelling season the chlorophyll-speciﬁc absorption coefﬁcient, aph(440), was nearly half the value observed during the rainy season due to changes in the package effect (explaining 40\% of the variability) and in accessory pigment composition as a result of species succession (explaining 60\% of the variability). The euphotic zone depth (depth of the 1\% photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) level) was typically shallower during the upwelling season (36.7 712.3 m) than during the rainy season (47.9 7 13.5 m) due to the onset of a shallower and stronger phytoplankton bloom. During upwelling, the highest chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chl 4 1 mg m 3) were observed in the upper 25 m with primary production rates exceeding 1800 mgC m 2 d 1. During the rainy season, a deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM, concentrations between 0.2 and 0.8 mg m 3) was observed between 35 and 55 m, with low ( o 0.2 mg m 3) Chl concentrations above this depth and primary production values of 990 mgC m 2 d 1. The DCM occurred immediately above the seasonal thermocline and around the 1\% PAR light level. During the upwelling season, no DCM was observed.},

Climate changedriven trends need to be accurately assessed and detected in a timely manner. As part of the effort towards detection of long-term trends, a network of ocean observatories and time series stations provide high quality data for a number of key parameters, such as pH, oxygen concentration or primary production (PP). Here, we use an ensemble of global coupled climate models to assess the temporal and spatial scales over which observations of eight biogeochemically relevant variables must be made to robustly detect a long-term trend. We ﬁnd that, as a global average, continuous time series are required for between 14 (pH) and 32 (PP) years to distinguish a climate change trend from natural variability. Regional differences are extensive, with low latitudes and the Arctic generally needing shorter time series ({\textless}{\textasciitilde}30 years) to detect trends than other areas. In addition, we quantify the ‘footprint’ of existing and planned time series stations, that is the area over which a station is representative of a broader region. Footprints are generally largest for pH and sea surface temperature, but nevertheless the existing network of observatories only represents 9–15\% of the global ocean surface. Our results present a quantitative framework for assessing the adequacy of current and future ocean observing networks for detection and monitoring of climate change-driven responses in the marine ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Evolutions of complex systems are expressions of the dynamic and uncertain behaviors and ever-changing causalities of the potential multivariate processes in a system, which exhibit the characteristics of uncertainties, nonlinear dynamics, and aperiodic fluctuation. These characteristics pose a major challenge for predicting the states of evolutions of complex systems accurately. Supervised learning methods in artificial intelligence, such as the artificial neural networks (ANNs) and the support vector machine (SVM), are suitable for nonlinear time series prediction. However, due to suffering from the issue of feature extraction relying on prior knowledge, and the weakness of shallow learning, traditional ANNs and SVM are hard to guarantee the prediction accuracy and stability. In this study, we propose a deep learning approach, which hybridizes a deep belief networks (DBNs) and a nonlinear kernel-based parallel evolutionary SVM (ESVM), to predict evolution states of complex systems in a classification manner. The proposed approach is tested by two case studies regarding the mobile robot navigation and the early-warningof-risk of harmful algal blooms. Computational results are compared with those of SVM and DBNs approaches, which demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms them, and can offer an intelligent decision support tool for predicting evolutions of complex systems.},

              et al.
              looked at the extinction rates across marine genera (groups of species) over the past 23 million years to determine intrinsic extinction rates and what traits or regions correspond to the highest rates. Combining patterns of intrinsic extinction with regions of high anthropogenic threat revealed taxa and areas, particularly in the tropics, where the risk of extinction will be especially high.

          , 
            Marine taxa are threatened by anthropogenic impacts, but knowledge of their extinction vulnerabilities is limited. The fossil record provides rich information on past extinctions that can help predict biotic responses. We show that over 23 million years, taxonomic membership and geographic range size consistently explain a large proportion of extinction risk variation in six major taxonomic groups. We assess intrinsic risk—extinction risk predicted by paleontologically calibrated models—for modern genera in these groups. Mapping the geographic distribution of these genera identifies coastal biogeographic provinces where fauna with high intrinsic risk are strongly affected by human activity or climate change. Such regions are disproportionately in the tropics, raising the possibility that these ecosystems may be particularly vulnerable to future extinctions. Intrinsic risk provides a prehuman baseline for considering current threats to marine biodiversity.},

	abstract = {Known for centuries, the geographical pattern of increasing biodiversity from the poles to the equator is one of the most pervasive features of life on Earth. A longstanding goal of biogeographers has been to understand the primary factors that generate and maintain high diversity in the tropics. Many ‘historical’ and ‘ecological’ hypotheses have been proposed and debated, but there is still little consensus. Recent discussions have centred around two main phenomena: phylogenetic niche conservatism and ecological productivity. These two factors play important roles, but accumulating theoretical and empirical studies suggest that the single most important factor is kinetics: the temperature dependence of ecological and evolutionary rates. The relatively high temperatures in the tropics generate and maintain high diversity because ‘the Red Queen runs faster when she is hot’.},

	abstract = {The era of big biodiversity data has led to rapid, exciting advances in the theoretical and applied biological, ecological and conservation sciences. While large genetic, geographic and trait databases are available, these are neither complete nor random samples of the globe. Gaps and biases in these databases reduce our inferential and predictive power, and this incompleteness is even more worrisome because we are ignorant of both its kind and magnitude. We performed a comprehensive examination of the taxonomic and spatial sampling in the most complete current databases for plant genes, locations and functional traits. To do this, we downloaded data from The Plant List (taxonomy), the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (locations), TRY (traits) and GenBank (genes). Only 17.7\% of the world's described and accepted land plant species feature in all three databases, meaning that more than 82\% of known plant biodiversity lacks representation in at least one database. Species coverage is highest for location data and lowest for genetic data. Bryophytes and orchids stand out taxonomically and the equatorial region stands out spatially as poorly represented in all databases. We have highlighted a number of clades and regions about which we know little functionally, spatially and genetically, on which we should set research targets. The scientific community should recognize and reward the significant value, both for biodiversity science and conservation, of filling in these gaps in our knowledge of the plant tree of life.},

	abstract = {This study tests the predictions of Huston’s dynamic equilibrium model of species richness. It examines field data showing the effects of silicates/disturbance and productivity on the number of coexisting species within a functional type (diatoms) in a community. Using multivariate statistical techniques, the pattern of phytoplankton species richness throughout the Caribbean islands is modelled in relation to overlapping gradients of silicates/disturbance and primary productivity originating from the Amazon and Orinoco rivers. Data were obtained from 44 Caribbean, South and Central American oceanographic stations sampled during the Caribbean Oceanographic Resources Exploration (CORE) of 1990. The results of the study give support to Huston’s dynamic equilibrium hypothesis, which predicts maximum species richness under conditions of intermediate productivity and disturbance. Fishery statistics for the region show that the diversity of harvested marine species of commercial importance is a mirror of the diversity of the phytoplankton. Some consequences of global environmental change to the dynamic equilibrium of the allocation of fishery resources between small Caribbean states are discussed.},

The Guajira peninsula has a small human population with limited infrastructure and limited opportunities for coastal research, yet its coastal upwelling system is unique in the Tropical Western Atlantic region. This report includes both ﬁeld observations along with a review of literature on the biodiversity of coastal eastern Guajira. In addition, it identiﬁes missing information on the coastal system that is key to its management and conservation. Mangrove wetlands along with submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) communities in a combination of consolidated and unconsolidated shorelines (e.g., rocky shores, cliffs, and beaches) form unique habitats in eastern Guajira. The diversity of these habitats is illustrated with the Bahia Hondita marine lagoon, where critical nursery habitat for several commercial valuable and endangered ﬁsheries species, including sharks and sea turtles, is observed. Less information is available on more cryptic fauna, invertebrates, and coastal plankton species. Several anthropogenic factors are threatening species diversity in coastal Guajira, including overgrazing, mining, and target-species overﬁshing. Additional threats, such as extreme weather events (e.g., storms and droughts) as well as changes in coastal water quality, are also impacting species. The protection of the Guajira’s biodiversity would depend on local communities’ governance and empowerment as well as law enforcement for mining and agriculture operations. Management plans can include reducing land-based sources of pollution and building coastal resilience for climate change.},

	abstract = {A rich body of knowledge links biodiversity to ecosystem functioning (BEF), but it is primarily focused on small scales. We review the current theory and identify six expectations for scale dependence in the BEF relationship: (1) a nonlinear change in the slope of the BEF relationship with spatial scale; (2) a scale-dependent relationship between ecosystem stability and spatial extent; (3) coexistence within and among sites will result in a positive BEF relationship at larger scales; (4) temporal autocorrelation in environmental variability affects species turnover and thus the change in BEF slope with scale; (5) connectivity in metacommunities generates nonlinear BEF and stability relationships by affecting population synchrony at local and regional scales; (6) spatial scaling in food web structure and diversity will generate scale dependence in ecosystem functioning. We suggest directions for synthesis that combine approaches in metaecosystem and metacommunity ecology and integrate cross-scale feedbacks. Tests of this theory may combine remote sensing with a generation of networked experiments that assess effects at multiple scales. We also show how anthropogenic land cover change may alter the scaling of the BEF relationship. New research on the role of scale in BEF will guide policy linking the goals of managing biodiversity and ecosystems.},

Pervasive sampling and observation biases exist across animals, with only 6.74\% of the globe sampled, and disproportionately poor tropical sampling. High elevations and deep seas are particularly unknown. Over 50\% of records in most groups account for under 2\% of species and citizen‐science only exacerbates biases. Additional data will be needed to overcome many of these biases, but we must increasingly value data publication to bridge this gap and better represent species' distributions from more distant and inaccessible areas, and provide the necessary basis for conservation and management.},

              Motivation
              The BioTIME database contains raw data on species identities and abundances in ecological assemblages through time. These data enable users to calculate temporal trends in biodiversity within and amongst assemblages using a broad range of metrics. BioTIME is being developed as a community‐led open‐source database of biodiversity time series. Our goal is to accelerate and facilitate quantitative analysis of temporal patterns of biodiversity in the Anthropocene.
            
            
              Main types of variables included
              The database contains 8,777,413 species abundance records, from assemblages consistently sampled for a minimum of 2 years, which need not necessarily be consecutive. In addition, the database contains metadata relating to sampling methodology and contextual information about each record.
            
            
              Spatial location and grain
              
                BioTIME is a global database of 547,161 unique sampling locations spanning the marine, freshwater and terrestrial realms. Grain size varies across datasets from 0.0000000158 km
                2
                (158 cm
                2

                2
                (1,000,000,000,000 cm
                2
                ).
              
            
            
              Time period and grain
              BioTIME records span from 1874 to 2016. The minimal temporal grain across all datasets in BioTIME is a year.
            
            
              Major taxa and level of measurement
              BioTIME includes data from 44,440 species across the plant and animal kingdoms, ranging from plants, plankton and terrestrial invertebrates to small and large vertebrates.

	abstract = {The structure of phytoplankton communities is thought to inﬂuence total productivity, trophic structure and the export of carbon below the mixed layer. Community structure is determined by a complex interaction between the physiological characteristics of each species, environmental conditions, resource availability, competition among species, and numerous loss terms. This complexity makes it very difﬁcult to predict how changes in environmental conditions will alter the structure of phytoplankton communities. Here we develop a hierarchical Bayesian model with variable selection to identify how temperature, salinity, irradiance, and macronutrient concentrations determine the abundance of the 67 dominant identiﬁed species at Station CARIACO in the Caribbean Sea. This approach allows us to overcome the statistical challenge presented by the highly correlated environmental variables. Approximately three-quarters of the variables for each species have little effect on phytoplankton abundance. About half of the species decline in abundance with increasing temperature. Diatom species’ abundances are much more likely to respond to changes in irradiance and nitrate concentration than dinoﬂagellates and dinoﬂagellate species’ abundances are more likely to respond to changes in salinity.},

	abstract = {The degree of structural complexity that should be incorporated in marine biogeochemical models is unclear. We know that the marine ecosystem is complex, and that its observed behaviour is attributable to the interaction of a large number of separate processes, but observations are scarce and often insufﬁcient to constrain more than a small number of model parameters. This issue is addressed using a novel algorithm that systematically removes model processes that are not constrained by observations. The algorithm is applied to a one-dimensional, eight component ecosystem-biogeochemistry model at two North Atlantic time-series sites. Between 11 and 14 of the 30 model parameters can be removed at each site with no signiﬁcant reduction in the model’s ability to ﬁt upper ocean (0–200 m) biogeochemical tracer and productivity data. The statistically optimal model structures and parameters provide estimates of the most likely state variables and ﬂuxes at each site. Differences in these estimates between the two sites indicate that the optimal models are specialised to both the physical environment and the assimilated observations. At each site the heavily reduced models may thus be suitable for diagnostic purposes but may not be sufﬁciently complex for more general applications, such as in global ocean general circulation models, or for predicting the response of marine systems to environmental change.},

The deepest waters of the Cariaco Basin exhibited long-term positive trends in temperature, salinity, hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, phosphate, methane, and silica. Earthquakes and coastal flooding also resulted in the delivery of sediment to the seafloor.

	abstract = {Whereas it is accepted that the population dynamics of higher organisms is strongly grounded in life history processes, such as the time taken to mature and reproduce, regulation in the abundance of aquatic protists is generally attributed to proximate properties of the environment in which they grow. We used 10 yr of data from the Gulf of Naples to determine the life history of a planktonic diatom, Pseudo-nitzschia multistriata, through the analysis of cell abundances and cell size patterns. Asexual and sexual phases recurred with remarkable regularity. Maximum abundance occurred annually, between the end of summer and the beginning of autumn, but cohorts of large cells, derived from sexual events, were found only every second year. We developed a model of population growth, based on parameters determined from laboratory cultures, with further tuning using information from natural populations. The model simulated the birth, maturation, and disappearance of age classes like those in natural populations, but only when we imposed seasonal variation in the rate of cell division and timed sexual reproduction during the stationary phase of a bloom. The model predicts that P. multistriata will become locally extinct if sexual reproduction does not occur within 4 yr. Our data and model show that coherent life cycle properties can emerge in natural populations of unicellular organisms, analogous to those in multicellular organisms, as a result of finely tuned regulation of cell division and sexual competence.},

Our analysis of literature on major functional traits in phytoplankton, such as parameters of nutrient-dependent growth and uptake, reveals physiological trade-offs in species abilities to acquire and utilize resources. These trade-offs, arising from fundamental relations such as cellular scaling laws and enzyme kinetics, deﬁne contrasting ecological strategies of nutrient acquisition. Major groups of marine eukaryotic phytoplankton have adopted distinct strategies with associated traits. These diverse strategies of nutrient utilization can explain the distribution patterns of major functional groups and size classes along nutrient availability gradients.},

But these variations are not well documented as synoptic taxonomic data are difficult to acquire. Here, we examine how phytoplankton assemblage and diversity vary between mesoscale eddies and submesoscale fronts. We use a multi-phytoplankton numerical model embedded in a mesoscale flow representative of the North Atlantic. Our model results suggest that the mesoscale flow dynamically distorts the niches predefined by environmental contrasts at the basin scale and that the phytoplankton diversity landscape varies over temporal and spatial scales that are one order of magnitude smaller than those of the basin-scale environmental conditions. We find that any assemblage and any level of diversity can occur in eddies and fronts. However, on a statistical level, the results suggest a tendency for larger diversity and more fast-growing types at fronts, where nutrient supplies are larger and where populations of adjacent water masses are constantly brought into contact; and lower diversity in the core of eddies, where water masses are kept isolated long enough to enable competitive exclusion.},

Satellite scatterometer wind estimates showed that changes in the wind preceded changes in hydrography by 1–2 weeks. Upward migration of isopleths within the upper 150 m was observed between November and May each year, when the Trade Wind was more intense. A seasonal deepening of the isopleths was observed when winds relaxed. A secondary upwelling event was observed every year between July and August, in response to an intensiﬁcation of the southward component of the Trade Wind. Interannual variation in the upwelling cycle was driven in part by variations in wind intensity and in part by other events at time scales of 1–3 months. The latter were associated with 90–140 m deep intrusions of Caribbean Sea water that forced waters above them to the surface. Satellite-derived sea surface height anomaly maps demonstrated that these events were related to cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies moving along the continental shelf. Waters deeper than 1200 m showed small temperature and salinity increases of 0.00751C yrÀ1 and 0.0016 yrÀ1, consistent with previous estimates.},

These data were combined with a time series of Seaviewing Wide-Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), advanced very high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR), and European Remote Sensing Satellite/QuikScat data to examine the spatial extent of a cold coastal upwelling plume and a phytoplankton bloom associated with it. The seasonal upwelling cycle was directly linked to the intensity of the Trade Winds, with sea-surface temperature (SST) changes lagging the wind by 1–2 weeks. The seasonal cycle of most properties was punctuated by transient phenomena, some of which caused subsurface ventilation and also high primary production events. Integrated primary production ranged from 650, 574, and 593 g C mÀ2 yrÀ1 in 1996, 1997, and 2001, respectively, to 372, 484, and 448 g C mÀ2 yrÀ1, respectively, in 1998, 1999, and 2000. The Rutgers vertical generalized production model (VGPM) was modiﬁed to reﬂect an increase in Assimilation Number (PBopt) with SST at the Cariaco time series station, because the original VGPM formulation suggested inhibition of primary production at SST4211C. Trap observations showed that between 9 and 10 g C mÀ2 yrÀ1 were delivered to the bottom at the Cariaco time series station, i.e. \$1.33\% of surface primary productivity. Annual particulate organic carbon ﬂux to the bottom over the area of the Cariaco Basin (waters 4100 m), estimated using SeaWiFS and AVHRR variable inputs and the updated VGPM, ranged from 6.77 Â 1010 to 7.61 Â 1010 g C.

How to allow for such a flexible response in marine ecosystem models is, however, not entirely clear. One particular way is to resolve the natural complexity of phytoplankton communities by explicitly incorporating a large number of species or plankton functional types. Alternatively, models of aggregate community properties focus on macroecological quantities such as total biomass, mean trait, and trait variance (or functional trait diversity), thus reducing the observed natural complexity to a few mathematical expressions. We developed the PhytoSFDM modelling tool, which can resolve species discretely and can capture aggregate community properties. The tool also provides a set of methods for treating diversity under realistic oceanographic settings. This model is coded in Python and is distributed as open-source software. PhytoSFDM is implemented in a zero-dimensional physical scheme and can be applied to any location of the global ocean. We show that aggregate community models reduce computational complexity while preserving relevant macroecological features of phytoplankton communities. Compared to species-explicit models, aggregate models are more manageable in terms of number of equations and have faster computational times. Further developments of this tool should address the caveats associated with the assumptions of aggregate community models and about implementations into spatially resolved physical settings (one-dimensional and three-dimensional). With PhytoSFDM we embrace the idea of promoting open-source software and encourage scientists to build on this modelling tool to further improve our understanding of the role that biodiversity plays in shaping marine ecosystems.},

Here we use a Bayesian approach and a trait-based model to extract trait values for 4 functional types and 10 diatom species from field data collected at Station L4 in the Western Channel Observatory, English Channel. We find differences in maximum net growth rate, temperature optimum and sensitivity, half-saturation constants for light and nitrogen, and density-dependent loss terms across the functional types. We find evidence of very high linear loss rates, suggesting that grazing may be even more important than commonly assumed and differences in density-dependent loss rates across functional types, indicating the presence of strong niche differentiation among functional types. Low half-saturation constants for nitrogen at the functional type level may indicate widespread mixotrophy. At the species level, we find a wide range of density-dependent effects, which may be a signal of diversity in grazing susceptibility or biotic interactions. This approach may be a way to obtain more realistic and better-constrained trait values for functional types to be used in ecosystem modeling.},

Microscopy results from the upper 55 m indicated that the abundance of microphytoplankton ( 420 mm) decreased by more than 5-fold from 1996 through 2010, accompanied by a change in diatom composition and a 4-fold reduction in large diatom cell numbers, particularly during upwelling periods. HPLC results also indicate a decline in diatoms, but not nearly to the same extent. Rather, HPLC data suggests a substantial reorganization of the phytoplankton community. Between the two time periods, there was a signiﬁcant deepening of high biomass concentrations from near surface waters to depths below 55 m. At the same time, phytoplankton diversity increased by 14\%, while seasonal variability in community composition declined. Vertical photopigment distributions of nanophytoplankton ( o20 mm) further showed signiﬁcant overall increases in coccolithophore, cryptophyte, and other phytoﬂagellate concentrations. The deepening in phytoplankton biomass below the mixed layer, the relative increase in smaller taxa, and the increasing homogeneity in phytoplankton distributions over time are likely a direct response to a reduction in upwelling intensity and a deepening of the euphotic zone associated with a decrease in the average trade winds of the region from 2006–2010, compared to 1996–2000. Surprisingly, the overall decline in large cells dominated by diatoms and an increase in smaller taxa has led to no signiﬁcant change in the export of particulate organic carbon (POC) to depth, contrary to many studies that predict increasing stratiﬁcation with future climate change scenarios will reduce POC export and carbon sequestration in the deep ocean.},

            Most ecosystem models used to predict changes in community composition with climate change assume species’ responses to environmental conditions are genetically fixed on the century scale, but this hypothesis has not been tested. Using an oceanographic time series with directional environmental changes, we show here that many phytoplankton species are able to track, on average, modest changes in temperature and irradiance, but not decreases in limiting nutrient concentrations, on decadal timescales. This result suggests that models that use genetically fixed traits may not provide reasonable projections for changes in biological communities in response to climate change over decadal to longer timescales.
          , 
            Model projections indicate that climate change may dramatically restructure phytoplankton communities, with cascading consequences for marine food webs. It is currently not known whether evolutionary change is likely to be able to keep pace with the rate of climate change. For simplicity, and in the absence of evidence to the contrary, most model projections assume species have fixed environmental preferences and will not adapt to changing environmental conditions on the century scale. Using 15 y of observations from Station CARIACO (Carbon Retention in a Colored Ocean), we show that most of the dominant species from a marine phytoplankton community were able to adapt their realized niches to track average increases in water temperature and irradiance, but the majority of species exhibited a fixed niche for nitrate. We do not know the extent of this adaptive capacity, so we cannot conclude that phytoplankton will be able to adapt to the changes anticipated over the next century, but community ecosystem models can no longer assume that phytoplankton cannot adapt.},

These models begin to resolve, and address the signiﬁcance of, diversity within functional groups. Seeded with diverse populations spanning prescribed regions of trait space, these simulations self-select community structure according to relative ﬁtness in the virtual environment. Such models are suited to considering ecological questions, such as the regulation of patterns of biodiversity, and to simulating the response to changing environments. A key issue for all such models is the constraint of viable trait space and trade-offs.

            The factors regulating phytoplankton community composition play a crucial role in structuring aquatic food webs. However, consensus is still lacking about the mechanisms underlying the observed biogeographical differences in cell size composition of phytoplankton communities. Here we use a trait-based model to disentangle these mechanisms in two contrasting regions of the Atlantic Ocean. In our model, the phytoplankton community can self-assemble based on a trade-off emerging from relationships between cell size and (1) nutrient uptake, (2) zooplankton grazing and (3) phytoplankton sinking. Grazing ‘pushes’ the community towards larger cell sizes, whereas nutrient uptake and sinking ‘pull’ the community towards smaller cell sizes. We find that the stable environmental conditions of the tropics strongly balance these forces leading to persistently small cell sizes and reduced size diversity. In contrast, the seasonality of the temperate region causes the community to regularly reorganize via shifts in species composition and to exhibit, on average, bigger cell sizes and higher size diversity than in the tropics. Our results raise the importance of environmental variability as a key structuring mechanism of plankton communities in the ocean and call for a reassessment of the current understanding of phytoplankton diversity patterns across latitudinal gradients.},

Statistical modes of ocean variability and their characteristic interannual to multidecadal timescales over the last century are described. Recent in situ and satellite time-series of primary production can be clearly linked to interannual ocean variability. Global marine primary production appears to have increased over the past several decades in association with multi-decadal variations.

	abstract = {Biodiversity of phytoplankton is important for ecosystem stability and marine biogeochemistry. However, the large-scale patterns of diversity are not well understood and are often poorly characterized in terms of statistical relationships with factors such as latitude, temperature and productivity. Here we use ecological theory and a global traitbased ecosystem model to provide mechanistic understanding of patterns of phytoplankton diversity. Our study suggests that phytoplankton diversity across three dimensions of trait space (size, biogeochemical function and thermal tolerance) is controlled by disparate combinations of drivers: the supply rate of the limiting resource, the imbalance in different resource supplies relative to competing phytoplankton demands, size-selective grazing and transport by the moving ocean. Using sensitivity studies we show that each dimension of diversity is controlled by different drivers. Models including only one (or two) of the trait dimensions will have different patterns of diversity than one which incorporates another trait dimension. We use the results of our model exploration to infer the controls on the diversity patterns derived from ﬁeld observations along meridional transects in the Atlantic and to explain why different taxa and size classes have differing patterns.},

Whereas the effects of species loss on ecosystem processes have received broad attention, the consequences of altered species dominance for emergent properties of communities and ecosystems are poorly investigated. Here we propose a framework guiding our understanding of how dominance affects species interactions within communities, processes within ecosystems, and dynamics on regional scales. Dominance (or the complementary term, evenness) reﬂects the distribution of traits in a community, which in turn affects the strength and sign of both intraspecifc and interspeciﬁc interactions. Consequently, dominance also mediates the effect of such interactions on species coexistence. We review the evidence for the fact that dominance directly affects ecosystem functions such as process rates via species identity (the dominant trait) and evenness (the frequency distribution of traits), and indirectly alters the relationship between process rates and species richness. Dominance also inﬂuences the temporal and spatial variability of aggregate community properties and compositional stability (invasibility). Finally, we propose that dominance affects regional species coexistence by altering metacommunity dynamics. Local dominance leads to high beta diversity, and rare species can persist because of source–sink dynamics, but anthropogenically induced environmental changes result in regional dominance and low beta diversity, reducing regional coexistence. Given the rapid anthropogenic alterations of dominance in many ecosystems and the strong implications of these changes, dominance should be considered explicitly in the analysis of consequences of altered biodiversity.},

	abstract = {A new model in the NPZ (nutrient–phytoplankton–zooplankton) style is presented, mechanistically simple but with 40 size classes each of phytoplankton (1–20 !m) and small zooplankton (2.1–460 !m), in order to resolve one level of trophic interactions in detail. General, empirical allometric relationships are used to parameterize both the optimal prey size and size selectivity for each grazer class, as is rarely done. This inclusion of complex predator–prey linkages and realistic prey preferences yields a system with an emergent pattern of phytoplankton diversity consistent with global ocean observations, i.e., a parabolic relationship between diversity (as measured by the Shannon evenness) and biomass. It also yields signiﬁcant long-term time evolution, which places limits on the extent to which the community response to nutrient forcing can be predicted from forcing in a pragmatic sense. When a simple annual cycle in nutrient supply is repeated exactly for many years, transient ﬂuctuations up to a factor of two in spring bloom magnitude persist for 10–20 years before a stable seasonal biomass cycle is achieved. When the amplitude of the nutrient-supply annual cycle is given a random interannual modulation, these long-lived transients add signiﬁcant noise to a 100-year correlation between annual-mean nutrient supply and annual-mean biomass. This noise is 20\% of total interannual variance in the model base case, and ranges from 0\% to 40\% depending on the grazer size selectivity. In general, unpredictability on the bloom timescale is damped when food-web complexity is increased by making grazers less selective, while unpredictability on the interannual scale shows the opposite pattern, increasing with increasing food-web complexity up to a high threshhold, past which community structure and biomass time evolution both suddenly simplify. These results suggests a new strategy for ensemble ecosystem forecasting and uncertainty estimation, analogous to methods common in circulation and climate modeling, in which internal variability (predator–prey interactions in the biological case; eddies and climate-system oscillations in the physical case) are resolved and quantiﬁed, rather than suppressed.},

	abstract = {Current aquatic ecosystem models accommodate increasing amounts of physiological detail, but marginalize the role of biodiversity by aggregating multitudes of different species. We propose that at present, understanding of aquatic ecosystems is likely to benefit more from improved descriptions of biodiversity and succession than from incorporation of more realistic physiology. To illustrate how biodiversity can be accounted for, we define the system of infinite diversity (SID), which characterizes ecosystems in the spirit of complex adaptive systems theory as single units adapting to environmental pressure. The SID describes an ecosystem with one generic population model and continuity in species-characterizing parameters, and acquires rich dynamics by modeling succession as evolution of the parameter value distribution. This is illustrated by a four-parameter phytoplankton model that minimizes physiological detail, but includes a sophisticated representation of community diversity and interspecific differences. This model captures several well-known aquatic ecosystem features, including formation of a deep chlorophyll maximum and nutrient-driven seasonal succession. As such, it integrates theories on changes in species composition in both time and space. We argue that despite a lack of physiological detail, SIDs may ultimately prove a valuable tool for further qualitative and quantitative understanding of ecosystems.},

However, in cases with substantial translocation, like planktonic organisms carried by ocean currents, selection may happen upstream and local environmental factors may not be representative of those that shaped the local population. Here we use an individual-based model of microbes in the global surface ocean to explore this effect for temperature. We simulate up to 25 million individual cells belonging to up to 50 species with different temperature optima. Microbes are moved around the globe based on a hydrodynamic model, and grow and die based on local temperature. We quantify the role of currents using the “advective temperature differential” metric, which is the optimum temperature of the most abundant species from the model with advection minus that from the model without advection. This differential depends on the location and can be up to 4˚C. Poleward-flowing currents, like the Gulf Stream, generally experience cooling and the differential is positive. We apply our results to three global datasets. For observations of optimum growth temperature of phytoplankton, accounting for the effect of currents leads to a slightly better agreement with observations, but there is large variability and the improvement is not statistically significant. For observed Prochlorococcus ecotype ratios and metagenome nucleotide divergence, accounting for advection improves the correlation significantly, especially in areas with relatively strong poleward or equatorward currents.},

            High-quality climate predictions are crucial for understanding the impacts of different greenhouse gas emission scenarios and for mitigating and adapting to the resulting climatic changes. Bonan and Doney review advances in Earth system models that include the terrestrial and marine biosphere. Such models capture interactions between physical and biological aspects of the Earth system. This provides insight into climate impacts of societal importance, such as altered crop yields, wildfire risk, and water availability. Further research is needed to better understand model uncertainties, some of which may be unavoidable, and to better translate observations into abstract model representations.

              BACKGROUND
              Earth system models (ESMs) simulate physical, chemical, and biological processes that underlie climate and are the most complex in a hierarchy of models of Earth’s interacting atmosphere–land–ocean–sea ice system. As terrestrial and marine ecosystems have been added to ESMs, the distinction between the physical basis for climate change, mitigation, and vulnerability, impacts, and adaptation (VIA) no longer necessarily holds. The same global change stresses that affect terrestrial and marine ecosystems are critical processes that determine the magnitude and trajectory of climate change, and many of the interventions that might lessen anthropogenic climate change pertain to the biosphere. Here we describe environmental changes that are stressing terrestrial and marine ecosystems. We discuss how these stressors are being included in ESMs, initially with an emphasis on climate processes, but also show their emerging utility for VIA analyses and examine them in the context of Earth system prediction.
            
            
              ADVANCES
              
                Terrestrial ecosystems face stresses from changing climate and atmospheric composition that alter phenology, growing season length, and community composition; these stresses enhance productivity and water-use efficiency in some regions, but also lead to mortality and increased disturbances from wildfires, insects, and extreme events in other regions. The addition of reactive nitrogen, elevated levels of tropospheric O
                3
                , and anthropogenic land-use and land-cover change stress ecosystems as well. The terrestrial biosphere models included in ESMs simulate the ecological impacts of these stresses and their effects on Earth system functioning. Ocean ecosystems and living marine resources face threats from ocean warming, changing large-scale circulation, increased vertical stratification, declining oxygen, and acidification, which alter nutrient supply, the light environment, and phytoplankton productivity; result in coral bleaching; and produce novel marine communities. Three-dimensional ocean models simulate the carbon cycle and associated biogeochemistry. Plankton ecosystem models both drive biogeochemistry models and characterize marine ecological dynamics.
              
            
            
              OUTLOOK
              The untapped potential of ESMs is to bring dispersed terrestrial and marine ecosystem research related to climate processes, VIA, and mitigation into a common framework. ESMs offer an opportunity to move beyond physical descriptors of atmospheric and oceanic states to societally relevant quantities such as habitat loss, water availability, wildfire risk, air quality, and crop, fishery, and timber yields. To do so, the science of climate prediction has to be extended to a more multifaceted Earth system prediction, including the biosphere and its resources. ESMs provide the means not just to assess the potential for future global change stresses, but also to determine the outcome of those stresses on the biosphere. Such Earth system prediction is necessary to inform sound policy that maintains a healthy biosphere and provides the food, energy, and fresh water needed for a growing global population without further exacerbating climate change. Substantial impediments that must be overcome include advancing our knowledge of biosphere-related climate processes; reducing model uncertainty; and effectively communicating among, rather than across, the disparate science communities of climate prediction, global biosphere modeling, VIA analyses, and climate change mitigation.
              
                
                  The various models used for climate projections and mitigation and VIA analyses overlap in scope and would benefit from a broad perspective of Earth system prediction.
                  Shown are the domains of ESMs, mitigation models, and VIA models along axes from VIA to climate processes (horizontal) and from primarily serving the research community to informing societal needs (vertical). Panels show forests and agriculture (left) and marine ecosystems (right) as represented across modeling domains.
                
                
              
            
          , 
            Many global change stresses on terrestrial and marine ecosystems affect not only ecosystem services that are essential to humankind, but also the trajectory of future climate by altering energy and mass exchanges with the atmosphere. Earth system models, which simulate terrestrial and marine ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles, offer a common framework for ecological research related to climate processes; analyses of vulnerability, impacts, and adaptation; and climate change mitigation. They provide an opportunity to move beyond physical descriptors of atmospheric and oceanic states to societally relevant quantities such as wildfire risk, habitat loss, water availability, and crop, fishery, and timber yields. To achieve this, the science of climate prediction must be extended to a more multifaceted Earth system prediction that includes the biosphere and its resources.},

	abstract = {Ecosystem processes are important determinants of the biogeochemistry of the ocean, and they can be profoundly affected by changes in climate. Ocean models currently express ecosystem processes through empirically derived parameterizations that tightly link key geochemical tracers to ocean physics. The explicit inclusion of ecosystem processes in models will permit ecological changes to be taken into account, and will allow us to address several important questions, including the causes of observed glacial–interglacial changes in atmospheric trace gases and aerosols, and how the oceanic uptake of CO2 is likely to change in the future. There is an urgent need to assess our mechanistic understanding of the environmental factors that exert control over marine ecosystems, and to represent their natural complexity based on theoretical understanding. We present a prototype design for a Dynamic Green Ocean Model (DGOM) based on the identiﬁcation of (a) key plankton functional types that need to be simulated explicitly to capture important biogeochemical processes in the ocean; (b) key processes controlling the growth and mortality of these functional types and hence their interactions; and (c) sources of information necessary to parameterize each of these processes within a modeling framework. We also develop a strategy for model evaluation, based on simulation of both past and present mean state and variability, and identify potential sources of validation data for each. Finally, we present a DGOM-based strategy for addressing key questions in ocean biogeochemistry. This paper thus presents ongoing work in ocean biogeochemical modeling, which, it is hoped will motivate international collaborations to improve our understanding of the role of the ocean in the climate system.},

	abstract = {The complexity of our mechanistic ecosystem (biogeochemical, eutrophication, phytoplankton, water quality) models has not changed substantially since they were developed in the 1970s. Consequently, there is now a large disconnect with contemporary problems (e.g., toxin production), knowledge of biological and ecological processes (e.g., intracellular mechanisms, sediment bed overwintering) and environmental observational technologies (e.g., metatransciptomics). This limits the utility of models for making predictions and supporting management. There are several reasons against increasing complexity, including (a) number of required assumptions, (b) risk of overﬁtting, (c) higher uncertainty, (d) missing knowledge, (e) lack of observations for calibration and validation and (f) difﬁculty of developing, running, analyzing and communicating the model. Here I review those arguments and conclude that, for mechanistic, predictive ecosystem modeling, they either do not apply, are not a signiﬁcant problem in practice or can readily be solved by providing more resources to modelers. Further, a review of these issues leads to the conclusion that more complexity generally increases the predictive skill of a model, because more information is used to constrain it. This can be formulated as a new rule: more in, more out (MIMO). MIMO suggests that more complex models make better predictions, but this should not be adopted as a universal modeling strategy, because in practice, the difﬁculty associated with developing, understanding and communicating complex models has to be considered. However, those are problems readily solved by more resources and I argue that more funding needs to be made available to develop complex ecosystem models.},

Phytoplankton communities, with a rich history as model systems in community ecology, are ideally suited for applying and further developing these concepts. Here we summarize the essential components of trait-based approaches and review their historical and potential application to illuminating phytoplankton community ecology. Major ecological axes relevant to phytoplankton include light and nutrient acquisition and use, natural enemy interactions, morphological variation, temperature sensitivity, and modes of reproduction. Tradeoffs between these traits play key roles in determining community structure. Freshwater and marine environments may select for a different suite of traits owing to their different physical and chemical properties. We describe mathematical techniques for integrating traits into measures of growth and ﬁtness and predicting how community structure varies along environmental gradients. Finally, we outline challenges and future directions for the application of trait-based approaches to phytoplankton ecology.},

	abstract = {We examined the effect of ﬁne-scale ﬂuid turbulence on phytoplankton community structure in an idealized, size-structured community model. It has been shown that turbulence can enhance nutrient transport toward a cell, particularly for larger cells in highly turbulent conditions. Our model suggests that under weak grazing pressure the effect of this mechanism on relative phytoplankton ﬁtness and community structure is negligible. Under these conditions, the high nutrient afﬁnity of small cells dominates relative ﬁtness and allows them to outcompete larger cells. In contrast, when grazing pressure is strong, the turbulent enhancement of nutrient uptake and ﬁtness for larger cells can become ecologically signiﬁcant. Here, increasing turbulence broadens the size range of coexisting phytoplankton and increases the size of the dominant cell type at equilibrium. We also estimate and map open ocean turbulent dissipation rates as a function of climatological surface wind stresses. The turbulent enhancement of nutrient uptake is most likely to be ecologically signiﬁcant in regions with low nutrient levels, strong grazing pressure, and relatively high turbulence, such as in windier portions of the subtropical gyre or post-bloom conditions at higher latitudes. In these regions, turbulence may help sustain larger cell populations through otherwise unfavorable environmental conditions.},

As a result, the vertical distribution of PP varies as well. Differences in the vertical distribution of PP have not, however, been systematically studied. Here, we focus on the open ocean and use nutricline depth, DNO3 (defined as the depth where [NO3−] = 1 µmol kg−1), as a proxy for nutrient availability in the euphotic zone. Using our own and archived (WOD, HOT, BATS, CARIACO) data, we show universal relationships between DNO3 and (1) depth of the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM), (2) total water column PP and (3) vertical distribution of PP. When DNO3 is located between {\textasciitilde}20 and 90 m, the DCM and DNO3 are juxtaposed. However, the DCM is located above nutriclines found at {\textgreater} {\textasciitilde}90 m. The observed relationships between DCM and DNO3 depths can be explained with a simple model including light and nutrient limitation. The global PP estimates indicate that {\textasciitilde}25\% of ocean PP occurs in the upper 10 m. Estimating total global ocean PP from surface optical characteristics and the relationship between vertical PP distribution and DNO3 indicates that oligotrophic regions of the ocean may be more productive than usually assumed. The relationship shown here between water column PP and DNO3 suggests that considering stratification characteristics in a future ocean is critical for predicting climate change effects on global PP.},

Here we report the first application of the 18S rRNA approach to a permanently anoxic environment, the Cariaco Basin off the Venezuelan coast. On the basis of rRNA sequences, we uncovered a substantial number of novel protistan lineages. These included new clades of the highest taxonomic level unrelated to any known eukaryote as well as deep branches within established protistan groups. Three novel lineages branch at the base of the eukaryotic evolutionary tree preceding, contemporary with, or immediately following the earliest eukaryotic branches. These newly discovered protists may retain traits reminiscent of an early eukaryotic ancestor(s).},

	abstract = {On the basis of the assumption that natural selection should tend to produce organisms optimally adapted to their environments, we consider optimality as a guiding concept for abstracting the behavior of aquatic microorganisms (plankton) to develop models to study and predict the behavior of planktonic organisms and communities. This is closely related to trait-based ecology, which considers that traits and functionality can be understood as the result of the optimization inherent in natural selection, subject to constraints imposed by fundamental processes necessary for life. This approach is particularly well suited to plankton because of their long evolutionary history and the ease with which they can be manipulated in experiments. We review recent quantitative modeling studies of planktonic organisms that have been based on the assumption that adaptation of species and acclimation of organisms maximize growth rate. Compared with mechanistic models not formulated in terms of optimality, this approach has in some cases yielded simpler models, and in others models of greater generality. The evolutionary success of any given species must depend on its interactions with both the physical environment and other organisms, which depend on the evolving traits of all organisms concerned. The concept of an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) can, at least in principle, constrain the choice of goal functions to be optimized in models. However, the major challenge remains of how to construct models at the level of organisms that can resolve short-term dynamics, e.g., of phytoplankton blooms, in a way consistent with ESS theory, which is formulated in terms of a steady state.},

Mobius was initially developed to support catchmentscale hydrology and water-quality modelling but can be used to represent any system of hierarchically structured ordinary differential equations, such as population dynamics or toxicological models. Here, we demonstrate how Mobius can be used to quickly prototype several different model structures for a dissolved organic carbon catchment model and use built-in auto-calibration and statistical uncertainty analysis tools to help decide on the best model structures. Overall, we hope the modular model building platform offered by Mobius will provide a step forward for environmental modelling, providing an alternative to the “one size ﬁts all” modelling paradigm. By making it easier to explore a broader range of model structures and parameterisations, users are encouraged to build more appropriate models, and in turn this improves process understanding and allows for more robust modelling in support of decision making.},

            Spatial diversity gradients are a pervasive feature of life on Earth. We examined a global ocean circulation, biogeochemistry, and ecosystem model that indicated a decrease in phytoplankton diversity with increasing latitude, consistent with observations of many marine and terrestrial taxa. In the modeled subpolar oceans, seasonal variability of the environment led to competitive exclusion of phytoplankton with slower growth rates and lower diversity. The relatively weak seasonality of the stable subtropical and tropical oceans in the global model enabled long exclusion time scales and prolonged coexistence of multiple phytoplankton with comparable fitness. Superimposed on the decline in diversity seen from equator to pole were “hot spots” of enhanced diversity in some regions of energetic ocean circulation, which reflected lateral dispersal.},

We present a spatially explicit resource competition model and investigate how the strength of these effects is influenced by trait and environmental variability, resource distribution, and species pool size. Our results demonstrate that the increase of biomass production with increasing species numbers depends on the concurrence of environmental and trait variability: BEF relationships are stronger if functionally different species coexist in a landscape with heterogeneous resource supply. These large biodiversity effects arise from complementarity effects, whereas selection effects are maximized when broad trait ranges coincide with narrow ranges of resource supply ratios. Our results will therefore help to resolve the debate on complementarity and selection mechanisms.},

            A key question in ecology and evolution is the relative role of natural selection and neutral evolution in producing biogeographic patterns. We quantify the role of neutral processes by simulating division, mutation, and death of 100,000 individual marine bacteria cells with full 1 million–base-pair genomes in a global surface ocean circulation model. The model is run for up to 100,000 years and output is analyzed using BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) alignment and metagenomics fragment recruitment. Simulations show the production and maintenance of biogeographic patterns, characterized by distinct provinces subject to mixing and periodic takeovers by neighbors (coalescence), after which neutral evolution reestablishes the province and the patterns reorganize. The emergent patterns are substantial (e.g., down to 99.5\% DNA identity between North and Central Pacific provinces) and suggest that microbes evolve faster than ocean currents can disperse them. This approach can also be used to explore environmental selection.},

	abstract = {The ability to detect ecological regime shifts in a data-limited setting was investigated, using southeast Australian ecosystems as a model. Community variability was summarized for 1968–2008 with the ﬁrst two principal components (PCs) of recruitment estimates for six ﬁsh stocks and reproductive parameters for four seabird species; regional climate was summarized for 1953–2008 with the ﬁrst two PCs for three parameters (sea surface temperature [SST], sea surface salinity, surface nitrate) measured at two stations; and basin-scale climate variability was summarized for 1950–2012 with mean South Paciﬁc SST and the ﬁrst two PCs of detrended South Paciﬁc SST. The ﬁrst two biology PCs explained 45\% of total community variability. The ﬁrst two PCs of basin-scale SST showed abrupt shifts similar to ‘‘regime” behavior observed in other ocean basins, and the ﬁrst PC of basin-scale SST showed signiﬁcant covariation with the ﬁrst PC of regional climate. Together, these results are consistent with the strong community variability and decadal-scale red noise climatic variability associated with Northern Hemisphere regime shifts. However, statistical model selection showed that the ﬁrst two PCs of regional climate and the ﬁrst PC of biology time series all exhibited linear change, rather than abrupt shifts. This result is consistent with previous studies documenting rapid linear change in the climate and biology of southeast Australian shelf ecosystems, and we conclude that there is no evidence for regime shift behavior in the region’s ecology. However, analysis of a large set of previously-published biological time series from the North Paciﬁc (n = 64) suggests that studies using fewer than 30 biological time series, such as this one, may be unable to detect regime shifts. Thus we conclude that the nature of ecological variability in the region cannot be determined with available data. The development of additional long-term biological observations is needed for understanding change in southeast Australia and in many other marine ecosystems globally. Ó 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Phylogenybased information can complement direct empirical evidence, and is particularly valuable if experiments on the species of interest are not feasible. The PhyloPars web server provides a statistically consistent method that combines an incomplete set of empirical observations with the species phylogeny to produce a complete set of parameter estimates for all species. It builds upon a state-of-the-art evolutionary model, extended with the ability to handle missing data. The resulting approach makes optimal use of all available information to produce estimates that can be an order of magnitude more accurate than ad-hoc alternatives. Uploading a phylogeny and incomplete feature matrix suffices to obtain estimates of all missing values, along with a measure of certainty. Real-time cross-validation provides further insight in the accuracy and bias expected for estimated values. The server allows for easy, efficient estimation of metabolic parameters, which can benefit a wide range of fields including systems biology and ecology.

	abstract = {The universal temperature dependence of metabolic rates has been used to predict how ocean biology will respond to ocean warming. Determining the temperature sensitivity of phytoplankton metabolism and growth is of special importance because this group of organisms is responsible for nearly half of global primary production, sustains most marine food webs, and contributes to regulate the exchange of CO2 between the ocean and the atmosphere. Phytoplankton growth rates increase with temperature under optimal growth conditions in the laboratory, but it is unclear whether the same degree of temperature dependence exists in nature, where resources are often limiting. Here we use concurrent measurements of phytoplankton biomass and carbon fixation rates in polar, temperate and tropical regions to determine the role of temperature and resource supply in controlling the large-scale variability of in situ metabolic rates. We identify a biogeographic pattern in phytoplankton metabolic rates, which increase from the oligotrophic subtropical gyres to temperate regions and then coastal waters. Variability in phytoplankton growth is driven by changes in resource supply and appears to be independent of seawater temperature. The lack of temperature sensitivity of realized phytoplankton growth is consistent with the limited applicability of Arrhenius enzymatic kinetics when substrate concentrations are low. Our results suggest that, due to widespread resource limitation in the ocean, the direct effect of sea surface warming upon phytoplankton growth and productivity may be smaller than anticipated.},

However, the role of phytoplankton functional diversity in ecosystem productivity and stability under ﬂuctuating (i.e. non-equilibrium) environments remains largely unknown. Here we use a marine ecosystem model to study the effect of phytoplankton functional diversity on both ecosystem productivity and its stability for seasonally variable nutrient supply and temperature. Functional diversity ranges from low to high along these two environmental axes independently. Changes in diversity are obtained by varying the range of uptake strategies and thermal preferences of the species present in the community. Species can range from resource gleaners to opportunists, and from cold to warm thermal preferences. The phytoplankton communities self-assemble as a result of species selection by resource competition (nutrients) and environmental ﬁltering (temperature). Both processes lead to species asynchrony but their effect on productivity and stability differ. We ﬁnd that the diversity of temperature niches has a strong and direct positive effect on productivity and stability due to species complementarity, while the diversity of uptake strategies has a weak and indirect positive effect due to sampling probability. These results show that more functionally diverse phytoplankton communities lead to higher and more stable ecosystem productivity but the positive effect of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning depends critically on the type of environmental gradient.},

	abstract = {With the eutrophication of many freshwaters and coastal environments, phytoplankton blooms have become a common phenomenon. This article uses a reaction-diffusion model to investigate the implications of mixing processes for the dynamics and species composition of phytoplankton blooms. The model identiﬁes four key parameters for bloom development: incident light intensity, background turbidity, water column depth, and turbulent mixing rates. The model predicts that the turbulent mixing rate is a major determinant of the species composition of phytoplankton blooms. In wellmixed environments, the species with lowest “critical light intensity” should become dominant. But at low mixing rates, the species with lowest critical light intensity is displaced if other species obtain a better position in the light gradient. Instead of a gradual change in species composition, the model predicts steep transitions between the dominance regions of the various species. The model predicts a low species diversity: phytoplankton blooms in eutrophic environments should be dominated by one or a few species only. The model predictions are consistent with laboratory competition experiments and many existing ﬁeld data. We recommend examining competition in phytoplankton blooms under well-controlled laboratory conditions, and we derive scaling rules that facilitate translation from the laboratory to the ﬁeld.},

The open source, Fortran-based Framework for Aquatic Biogeochemical Models addresses these problems by providing a consistent set of programming interfaces through which hydrodynamic and biogeochemical models communicate. Models are coded once to connect to FABM, after which arbitrary combinations of hydrodynamic and biogeochemical models can be made. Thus, a biogeochemical model code works unmodiﬁed within models of a chemostat, a vertically structured water column, and a three-dimensional basin. Moreover, complex biogeochemistry can be distributed over many compact, self-contained modules, coupled at run-time. By enabling distributed development and user-controlled coupling of biogeochemical models, FABM enables optimal use of the expertise of scientists, programmers and end-users.},

We compared wind patterns most relevant to ocean circulation (surface wind stress, its curl and estimates of induced vertical upwelling velocity) across global and regional scales, with added emphasis on the main Eastern Boundary Upwelling Ecosystems (EBUEs). All products provided consistent large-scale patterns in surface winds and wind stress, although agreement was reduced for indices involving the calculation of spatial derivatives, like wind stress curl and Ekman pumping. Fidelity with respect to a reference reanalysis based on blended satellite and buoy observations (CCMP v2.0) improved in more recent, higher resolution products like JRA-55 and ERAInterim. Adjustments applied when deriving ocean forcing data sets from atmospheric reanalysis robustly improved wind speed and wind stress vectors, but degraded wind stress curl (and implied Ekman upwelling) in two of the three ocean forcing products considered (DFS v5.2 and CORE v2.1).},

	abstract = {The trait-based approach is increasingly used in plankton ecology to understand diversity, community dynamics, and biogeography. While on the global scale phytoplankton traits are fairly well established, zooplankton traits are only beginning to be understood. One taxa-transcending aspect of zooplankton diversity is the distinction between ambush and active feeding strategies. We present a global-scale empirical estimate of feeding strategy derived from copepod abundance observations, which for the ﬁrst time suggests a distinct trait biogeography with ambush feeding as the dominant feeding strategy at higher, but not at lower latitudes. To explain this trait biogeography, we develop a minimalist trade-off based model of feeding strategies based on encounter rates between zooplankton predators and their phyto- and zooplankton prey. Encounter rates are governed by the two traits, size and motility, that trade off against predation risk. Coupled to a threedimensional dynamic green ocean model, our idealized encounter model captures the observed feeding strategy biogeography. In the model, this pattern arises from competing dominant food chains within the food web and is shaped by a trophic trait cascade of active vs. passive feeding in adjacent trophic levels. The dominant feeding strategy structures the pathways and efﬁciency of energy and biomass transfer through the model food web, with consequences for primary production, export and higher trophic levels. Understanding feeding strategies is therefore important for ﬁsheries, biogeochemical cycling, and long-term predictions of ecosystem dynamics and functioning by global dynamic green ocean models.},

Validation means that a model is acceptable for its intended use because it meets specified performance requirements.

The validation process can be decomposed into several components: (1) operation, (2) theory, and (3) data. Important concepts needed to understand the model evaluation process are verification, calibration, validation, credibility, and qualification. These terms are defined in a limited technical sense applicable to the evaluation of simulation models, and not as general philosophical concepts.

              There have been many individual phytoplankton datasets collected across Australia since the mid 1900s, but most are unavailable to the research community. We have searched archives, contacted researchers, and scanned the primary and grey literature to collate 3,621,847 records of marine phytoplankton species from Australian waters from 1844 to the present. Many of these are small datasets collected for local questions, but combined they provide over 170 years of data on phytoplankton communities in Australian waters. Units and taxonomy have been standardised, obviously erroneous data removed, and all metadata included. We have lodged this dataset with the Australian Ocean Data Network (
              http://portal.aodn.org.au/
              ) allowing public access. The Australian Phytoplankton Database will be invaluable for global change studies, as it allows analysis of ecological indicators of climate change and eutrophication (e.g., changes in distribution; diatom:dinoflagellate ratios). In addition, the standardised conversion of abundance records to biomass provides modellers with quantifiable data to initialise and validate ecosystem models of lower marine trophic levels.},

	abstract = {The discussions in the Villefranche Workshop covered a wide range of issues. The term regime shift was originally conﬁned to spatial or temporal correspondences between climatic indices and population abundance. The body of evidence for physical–biological coupling has certainly generated a much better appreciation of the natural decadal scale variability in marine systems. It is diﬃcult, however, to deduce from these time series, the mechanisms or trophic pathways that produce the correspondence. Ideally, we would need experimental manipulations such as those used in small lakes, to unravel the causal connections. Since this is impossible in the open sea, we must use comparisons between systems subject to diﬀerent types of perturbation or stress. We focused at the Workshop on the eﬀects of overﬁshing in diﬀerent marine regimes. The consequences of large scale changes in community structure imposed by excessive ﬁshing give valuable case studies. Coral reefs, rocky shores, freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems provide other examples. The possible existence of similar processes across such diverse systems raises corresponding questions about common ecological principles. The adaptive beneﬁts of maximizing resilience (deﬁned as minimizing the largest eigenvalue of the perturbed system) were considered. The corollary of this assumption is that, at the limits of adaptation, there will be switching between communities, providing a potential ground for a broad deﬁnition of regime shifts.},

In contrast to the typical approach of resolving distinct species or functional groups, we present a ContInuous TRAiT-basEd phytoplankton model (CITRATE) that focuses on macroscopic system properties such as total biomass, mean trait values, and trait variance. This phytoplankton component is embedded within a nitrogen–phytoplankton-zooplankton–detritus–iron model that itself is coupled with a simpliﬁed one-dimensional ocean model. Size is used as the master trait for phytoplankton. CITRATE also incorporates “trait diffusion” for sustaining diversity and simple representations of physiological acclimation, i.e., ﬂexible chlorophyllto-carbon and nitrogen-to-carbon ratios. We have implemented CITRATE at two contrasting stations in the North Paciﬁc where several years of observational data are available. The model is driven by physical forcing including vertical eddy diffusivity imported from three-dimensional general ocean circulation models (GCMs). One common set of model parameters for the two stations is optimized using the Delayed-Rejection Adaptive Metropolis–Hasting Monte Carlo (DRAM) algorithm. The model faithfully reproduces most of the observed patterns and gives robust predictions on phytoplankton mean size and size diversity. CITRATE is suitable for applications in GCMs and constitutes a prototype upon which more sophisticated continuous trait-based models can be developed.},

However, we still lack adequate theories and models to provide robust generalizations, predictions, and interpretations for such results. Here I present a mechanistic model of a spatially structured ecosystem in which plants compete for a limiting soil nutrient. This model shows that plant species richness does not necessarily enhance ecosystem processes, but it identifies two types of factors that could generate such an effect: (i) complementarity among species in the space they occupy below ground and (ii) positive correlation between mean resource-use intensity and diversity. In both cases, the model predicts that plant biomass, primary productivity, and nutrient retention all increase with diversity, similar to results reported in recent field experiments. These two factors, however, have different implications for the understanding of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. The model also shows that the effect of species richness on productivity or other ecosystem processes is masked by the effects of physical environmental parameters on these processes. Therefore, comparisons among sites cannot reveal it, unless abiotic conditions are very tightly controlled. Identifying and separating out the mechanisms behind ecosystem responses to biodiversity should become the focus of future experiments.},

	abstract = {In aquatic ecosystems, unicellular algae form the basis of the food webs. Theoretical and experimental studies have demonstrated that one of the mechanisms that maintain high diversity of phytoplankton is through predation and the consequent evolution of defence mechanisms. Proposed defence mechanisms in phytoplankton are diverse and include physiological (e.g. toxicity, bioluminescence), morphological (e.g. silica shell, colony formation), and behavioural (e.g. escape response) traits. However, the function of many of the proposed defence mechanisms remains elusive, and the costs and beneﬁts (trade-offs) are often unquantiﬁed or undocumented. Here, we provide an overview of suggested phytoplankton defensive traits and review their experimental support. Wherever possible we quantify the trade-offs from experimental evidence and theoretical considerations. In many instances, experimental evidence suggests that defences are costless. However, we argue that (i) some costs materialize only under natural conditions, for example, sinking losses, or dependency on the availability of speciﬁc nutrients, and (ii) other costs become evident only under resource-deﬁcient conditions where a rivalry for limiting resources between growth and defence occurs. Based on these ﬁndings, we suggest two strategies for quantifying the costs of defence mechanisms in phytoplankton: (i) for the evaluation of defence costs that are realized under natural conditions, a mechanistic understanding of the hypothesized component processes is required; and (ii) the magnitude of the costs (i.e. growth reduction) must be assessed under conditions of resource limitation.},

Using
              in situ
              phytoplankton size distribution data and a trait-based model, we find an increase in the average phytoplankton size, size diversity, primary production and export when moving from low to high latitudes. Our analysis indicates that the interplay between spatio-temporal heterogeneities in environmental conditions and a trade-off between the high affinity for nutrients of smaller cells and the ability to avoid predation by larger cells are the main mechanisms driving the observed patterns. Our results also suggest that variations in size diversity alone do not directly lead to changes in primary production and export. The trade-off thus introduces a feedback that influences the relationship between size diversity and ecosystem functions. These findings support the importance of environmentally mediated trade-offs as crucial mechanisms shaping biodiversity and ecosystem function relationships at large spatial scales.},

On one hand, we see these communities as composed of a diverse mixture of taxonomically and biogeochemically distinct species; pelagic ecosystem models capable of predicting the ocean’s role in the global carbon cycle will need to resolve these multiple plankton taxa. However, we have also come to appreciate that superimposed on this diversity are regular patterns of size structure, where plots of abundance within size classes typically show a power-law dependence on size. A truly complete model description of planktonic community structure must reﬂect both aspects of this duality. Here I examine two classes of ecosystem models that are capable of representing this duality. The ﬁrst structure is based on multiple (n) couplets of phytoplankton (P) and zooplankton (Z) [an ‘n(PZ)’ model]. Within certain regions of parameter space, this model structure can produce anomalous oscillatory behaviors, the mathematical origin of which is explored in detail. I then examine an alternative food web structure in which total herbivore abundance is represented by a single state variable, G, and where grazing pressure is distributed among taxa in proportion to their abundances. This ‘(nP)G’ system is stabilized by the redistribution of grazing intensity among taxa in response to changes in their densities. This ‘distributed grazing’ model also naturally produces size spectra of plankton abundance; this last observation argues that the model with distributed grazing can help in uncovering and representing the mechanistic basis for the genesis and maintenance of planktonic size spectra of phytoplankton and bacteria.},

The linear size ratio between predators and their optimal prey is 1 : 1 for a dinoflagellate, 3 : 1 for other flagellates, 8 : 1 for ciliates, 18 : 1 for rotifers and copepods, and - 50 : 1 for cladocerans and meroplankton larvae. These size ratios seem consistent within groups, and their validity is supported by quantitative information from the literature. However, a difference between filter feeders and raptorialinterception feeders, preferring relatively smaller and larger prey respectively, is evident across the taxonomic groups. A classification of planktonic predators into functional groups is therefore crucial for the construction of models of pelagic food webs.},

The concept of transparency at all stages of the research process, coupled with free and open access to data, code, and papers, constitutes ‘‘open science.’’ Despite the many benefits of an open approach to science, a number of barriers to entry exist that may prevent researchers from embracing openness in their own work. Here we describe several key shifts in mindset that underpin the transition to more open science. These shifts in mindset include thinking about data stewardship rather than data ownership, embracing transparency throughout the data life-cycle and project duration, and accepting critique in public. Though foreign and perhaps frightening at first, these changes in thinking stand to benefit the field of ecology by fostering collegiality and broadening access to data and findings. We present an overview of tools and best practices that can enable these shifts in mindset at each stage of the research process, including tools to support data management planning and reproducible analyses, strategies for soliciting constructive feedback throughout the research process, and methods of broadening access to final research products.},

	abstract = {Functional–structural plant models (FSPMs) are powerful tools to explore the complex interplays between plant growth, underlying physiological processes and the environment. Various modelling platforms dedicated to FSPMs have been developed with limited support for collaborative and distributed model design, reproducibility and dissemination. With the objective to alleviate these problems, we used the Jupyter project, an open-source computational notebook ecosystem, to create virtual modelling environments for plant models. These environments combined Python scientific modules, L-systems formalism, multidimensional arrays and 3D plant architecture visualization in Jupyter notebooks. As a case study, we present an application of such an environment by reimplementing V-Mango, a model of mango tree development and fruit production built on interrelated processes of architectural development and fruit growth that are affected by temporal, structural and environmental factors. This new implementation increased model modularity, with modules representing single processes and the workflows between them. The model modularity allowed us to run simulations for a subset of processes only, on simulated or empirical architectures. The exploration of carbohydrate source–sink relationships on a measured mango branch architecture illustrates this possibility. We also proposed solutions for visualization, distant distributed computation and parallel simulations of several independent mango trees during a growing season. The development of models on locations far from computational resources makes collaborative and distributed model design and implementation possible, and demonstrates the usefulness and efficiency of a customizable virtual modelling environment.},

Nevertheless, our lives are strongly based on services provided by ecosystems, thus the responses to global change of our natural heritage are of immediate concern. Understanding the relationship between complexity and stability of ecosystems is of key importance for the maintenance of the balance of human growth and the conservation of all the natural services that ecosystems provide. Mathematical network models can be used to simplify the vast complexity of the real world, to formally describe and investigate ecological phenomena, and to understand ecosystems propensity of returning to its functioning regime after a stress or a perturbation. The use of ecological-network models to study the relationship between complexity and stability of natural ecosystems is the focus of this review. The concept of ecological networks and their characteristics are first introduced, followed by central and occasionally contrasting definitions of complexity and stability. The literature on the relationship between complexity and stability in different types of models and in real ecosystems is then reviewed, highlighting the theoretical debate and the lack of consensual agreement. The summary of the importance of this line of research for the successful management and conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services concludes the review.},

	abstract = {Zooplankton are the intermediate trophic level between phytoplankton and ﬁsh, and are an important component of carbon and nutrient cycles, accounting for a large proportion of the energy transfer to pelagic ﬁshes and the deep ocean. Given zooplankton’s importance, models need to adequately represent zooplankton dynamics. A major obstacle, though, is the lack of model assessment. Here we try and stimulate the assessment of zooplankton in models by ﬁlling three gaps. The ﬁrst is that many zooplankton observationalists are unfamiliar with the biogeochemical, ecosystem, size-based and individual-based models that have zooplankton functional groups, so we describe their primary uses and how each typically represents zooplankton. The second gap is that many modelers are unaware of the zooplankton data that are available, and are unaccustomed to the different zooplankton sampling systems, so we describe the main sampling platforms and discuss their strengths and weaknesses for model assessment. Filling these gaps in our understanding of models and observations provides the necessary context to address the last gap—a blueprint for model assessment of zooplankton. We detail two ways that zooplankton biomass/abundance observations can be used to assess models: data wrangling that transforms observations to be more similar to model output; and observation models that transform model outputs to be more like observations. We hope that this review will encourage greater assessment of zooplankton in models and ultimately improve the representation of their dynamics.},

Hydrogen sulphide reaches maximum concentrations of .03 mgA sulphide S per litre, which is about 10\% of the concentration found in the depths of the Black Sea. Inorganic phosphate is linearly related to the oxygen and sulphate consumption in a ratio equivalent to 235 atoms of oxygen utilized for the production of 1 atom of phosphate. The anaerobic zone is free of nitrate and nitrite, but some ammonia is present. It is suggested that most of the nitrogen arising from decomposition of organic matter is present as elementary N2 in solution. The age of the water is estimated to be between 100 and 2,000 years. The physical properties of the trench are compared with those of other isolated basins.},

A second upwelling was recently detected in the southeastern Caribbean during June–August, when local coastal wind intensities weaken. Using synoptic satellite measurements and in situ data, this mid-year upwelling was characterized in terms of surface and subsurface temperature structures, and its mechanisms were explored. The mid-year upwelling lasts 6–9 weeks with satellite sea surface temperature (SST) {\textasciitilde}1–2◦ C warmer than the primary upwelling. Three possible upwelling mechanisms were analyzed: cross-shore Ekman transport (csET) due to alongshore winds, wind curl (Ekman pumping/suction) due to wind spatial gradients, and dynamic uplift caused by variations in the strength/position of the Caribbean Current. These parameters were derived from satellite wind and altimeter observations. The principal and the mid-year upwelling were driven primarily by csET (78–86\%). However, SST had similar or better correlations with the Ekman pumping/suction integrated up to 100 km offshore (WE100) than with csET, possibly due to its inﬂuence on the isopycnal depth of the source waters for the coastal upwelling. The mid-year upwelling was not caused by dynamic uplift but it might have been enhanced by the seasonal intensiﬁcation of the Caribbean Current during that period.},

With appropriate conversion factors, numerical species abundance can be expressed as biovolume and then converted to phytoplankton carbon. To-date there has been no attempt to analyze globally distributed phytoplankton data sets to determine the most appropriate species-speciﬁc mean cell volume. We have determined phytoplankton cell volumes for 214 of the most common species found in globally distributed coastal time series. The cell volume, carbon/cell and cell density of large diatoms is 200,000, 20,000 and 0.1 times respectively, compared to small diatoms. The cell volume, carbon/cell and cell density of large dinoﬂagellates is 1500, 1000 and 0.7 times respectively, compared to small dinoﬂagellates. The range in diatom biovolumes is 100 times greater than across dinoﬂagellates (i.e. {\textgreater}200,000 vs. 1500 times) and within any diatom species, the range in biovolume is up to 10-fold. Variation in diatom cell volumes are the single largest source of uncertainty in community phytoplankton carbon estimates and greatly exceeds the uncertainty associated with the different volume to carbon estimates. Small diatoms have 10 times more carbon density than large diatoms and small dinoﬂagellates have 1.5 times more carbon density than large cells. However, carbon density varies relatively little compared to biovolume. We recommend that monthly biovolumes should be determined on ﬁeld samples, at least for the most important species in each study area, since these measurements will incorporate the effects of variations in light, temperature, nutrients and life cycles. Since biovolumes of diatoms are particularly variable, the use of size classes will help to capture the percentage of large and small cells for each species at certain times of the year. This summary of global datasets of phytoplankton biovolumes is useful in order to evaluate where locally determined biovolumes lie within the global spectrum of spatial and temporal variations and may be used as a species cell volume reference where no locally determined volume estimates are available. There is a need to adopt standard protocols for measuring biovolumes and documenting the accompanying metadata which would improve inter-comparability among time series data sets.},

            The variability of marine diatom Si:C and Si:N composition ratios was examined to assess their utility as ecological conversion factors. Twenty‐seven diatom species grown under an 18:6 h LD cycle and sampled at the end of the light period gave mean ratios, by atoms, of 0.13 ± 0.04 and 1.12 ± 0.33 for Si:C and Si:N ratios, respectively (95\% C.I. reported). The mean ratios for 18 species grown under continuous illumination were 0.12 ± 0.03 for Si:C and 0.95 ± 0.23 for Si:N. The mean ratios of the clones grown under constant light were not statistically different from those calculated for the same species grown under an 18:6 h LD photoperiod. The overall mean Si:C and Si:N ratios for the 18:6 h LD and continuous light experiments taken together, weighted by the number of species in each experiment, are 0.13 and 1.05, respectively. The average ratios for the nine nanoplankton species ({\textless}20 μm) examined were 0.09 ± 0.03 for Si:C and 0.80 ± 0.35 for Si:N. The eighteen netplankton species ({\textgreater}20 μm) had higher mean ratios, Si:C = 0.15 ± 0.04 and Si:N = 1.20 ± 0.37.
            
              Time course sampling throughout a 24 h period revealed twofold variations in both ratios for individual species grown on a 14:10 h LD cycle. Changes in irradiance can also produce factor of two variations, both ratios being higher under low light. Comparisons of these data with those from the literature regarding the effects of temperature and nutrient limitation on diatom elemental composition suggest that use of these ratios to convert field estimates of biogenic silica into nitrogen or carbon units, or to estimate silica production from
              14

              C data at the Bermuda Atlantic Time series Study (BATS) and the Hawaii Ocean Time series (HOT) over nearly two decades. Specifically, skill was assessed based on the models' ability to estimate the observed mean, variability, and trends of NPP. At both sites, more than 90\% of the models underestimated mean NPP, with the average bias of the BOGCMs being nearly twice that of the ocean color models. However, the difference in overall skill between the best BOGCM and the best ocean color model at each site was not significant. Between 1989 and 2007, in situ NPP at BATS and HOT increased by an average of nearly 2\% per year and was positively correlated to the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation index. The majority of ocean color models produced in situ NPP trends that were closer to the observed trends when chlorophyll‐

We use the model to explore the global structure of marine ecosystems, highlighting the importance of both nutrient and grazer controls. The model suggests that zooplankton : phytoplankton (Z : P) biomass ratios may vary from an order of 0.1 in the oligotrophic gyres to an order of 10 in upwelling and highlatitude regions. Global estimates of the strength of bottom-up and top-down controls within plankton size classes suggest that these large-scale gradients in Z : P ratios are driven by a shift from strong bottom-up, nutrient limitation in the oligotrophic gyres to the dominance of top-down, grazing controls in more productive regions.},

There are signiﬁcant differences across taxa in a and lmax, with dinoﬂagellates, raphidophytes, and diazotrophs having the lowest values for both traits, and Phaeocystis spp. and diatoms having relatively high values. Iopt does not vary among taxonomic groups, and all traits exhibit large variation within most groups. Open-ocean isolates tend to have higher a, lower Iopt, and lower lmax than coastal isolates, implying adaptation to low light and low productivity. The three traits are correlated across species such that a and Iopt are negatively related while lmax is positively correlated with both of these traits. There is some evidence that high a carries a cost of high N demand even when nitrogen (not light) is limiting. The results elucidate contrasting light-related ecological strategies across phytoplankton and should help improve the parameterization of major functional groups in biogeochemical models.},

              The biodiversity and high productivity of coastal terrestrial and aquatic habitats are the foundation for important benefits to human societies around the world. These globally distributed habitats need frequent and broad systematic assessments, but field surveys only cover a small fraction of these areas. Satellite‐based sensors can repeatedly record the visible and near‐infrared reflectance spectra that contain the absorption, scattering, and fluorescence signatures of functional phytoplankton groups, colored dissolved matter, and particulate matter near the surface ocean, and of biologically structured habitats (floating and emergent vegetation, benthic habitats like coral, seagrass, and algae). These measures can be incorporated into Essential Biodiversity Variables (
              EBV
              s), including the distribution, abundance, and traits of groups of species populations, and used to evaluate habitat fragmentation. However, current and planned satellites are not designed to observe the
              EBV
              s that change rapidly with extreme tides, salinity, temperatures, storms, pollution, or physical habitat destruction over scales relevant to human activity. Making these observations requires a new generation of satellite sensors able to sample with these combined characteristics: (1)
              spatial resolution
              on the order of 30 to 100‐m pixels or smaller; (2)
              spectral resolution
              on the order of 5 nm in the visible and 10 nm in the short‐wave infrared spectrum (or at least two or more bands at 1,030, 1,240, 1,630, 2,125, and/or 2,260 nm) for atmospheric correction and aquatic and vegetation assessments; (3)
              radiometric quality
              with signal to noise ratios (
              SNR
              ) above 800 (relative to signal levels typical of the open ocean), 14‐bit digitization, absolute radiometric calibration {\textless}2\%, relative calibration of 0.2\%, polarization sensitivity {\textless}1\%, high radiometric stability and linearity, and operations designed to minimize sunglint; and (4)
              temporal resolution
              of hours to days. We refer to these combined specifications as
              H4
              imaging. Enabling
              H4
              imaging is vital for the conservation and management of global biodiversity and ecosystem services, including food provisioning and water security. An agile satellite in a 3‐d repeat low‐Earth orbit could sample 30‐km swath images of several hundred coastal habitats daily. Nine
              H4
              satellites would provide weekly coverage of global coastal zones. Such satellite constellations are now feasible and are used in various applications.},

	abstract = {Zooplankton is a morphologically and taxonomically diverse group and includes organisms that vary in size by many orders of magnitude, but they are all faced with the common problem of collecting food from a very dilute suspension. In order to maintain a viable population in the face of mortality, zooplankton in the ocean have to clear daily a volume of ambient water for prey particles that is equivalent to about 106 times their own body volume. While most size-speciﬁc vital rates and mortality rates decline with size, the clearance requirement is largely size-independent because food availability also declines with size. There is a limited number of solutions to the problem of concentrating dilute prey from a sticky medium: passive and active ambush feeding; feeding-current feeding, where the prey is either intercepted directly, retained on a ﬁlter, or individually perceived and extracted from the feeding current; cruise feeding; and colonization of large particles and marine snow aggregates. The basic mechanics of these food-collection mechanisms are described, and it is shown that their efﬁciencies are inherently different and that each of these mechanisms becomes less efﬁcient with increasing size. Mechanisms that compensate for this decline in efﬁciency are described, including inﬂation of feeding structures and development of vision. Each feeding mode has implications beyond feeding in terms of risk of encountering predators and chance of meeting mates, and they partly target different types of prey. The main dichotomy is between (inefﬁcient) ambush feeding on motile prey and the more efﬁcient active feeding modes; a secondary dichotomy is between (efﬁcient) hovering and (less efﬁcient) cruising feeding modes. The efﬁciencies of the various feeding modes are traded off against feeding-mode-dependent metabolic expenses, predation risks, and mating chances. The optimality of feeding strategies, evaluated as the ratio of gain over risk, varies with the environment, and may explain both size-dependent and spatio-temporal differences in distributions of various feeding types as well as other aspects of the biology of zooplankton (mating behaviour, predator defence strategies).},

	abstract = {Abstract. Modelling marine ecosystems requires insight and judgement when it comes to deciding upon appropriate model structure, equations and parameterisation. Many processes are relatively poorly understood and tough decisions must be made as to how to mathematically simplify the real world. Here, we present an efficient plankton modelling testbed, EMPOWER-1.0 (Efficient Model of Planktonic ecOsystems WrittEn in R), coded in the freely available language R. The testbed uses simple two-layer "slab" physics whereby a seasonally varying mixed layer which contains the planktonic marine ecosystem is positioned above a deep layer that contains only nutrient. As such, EMPOWER-1.0 provides a readily available and easy to use tool for evaluating model structure, formulations and parameterisation. The code is transparent and modular such that modifications and changes to model formulation are easily implemented allowing users to investigate and familiarise themselves with the inner workings of their models. It can be used either for preliminary model testing to set the stage for further work, e.g. coupling the ecosystem model to 1-D or 3-D physics, or for undertaking front line research in its own right. EMPOWER-1.0 also serves as an ideal teaching tool. In order to demonstrate the utility of EMPOWER-1.0, we implemented a simple nutrient–phytoplankton–zooplankton–detritus (NPZD) ecosystem model and carried out both a parameter tuning exercise and structural sensitivity analysis. Parameter tuning was demonstrated for four contrasting ocean sites, focusing on station BIOTRANS in the North Atlantic (47° N, 20° W), highlighting both the utility of undertaking a planned sensitivity analysis for this purpose, yet also the subjectivity which nevertheless surrounds the choice of which parameters to tune. Structural sensitivity tests were then performed comparing different equations for calculating daily depth-integrated photosynthesis, as well as mortality terms for both phytoplankton and zooplankton. Regarding the calculation of daily photosynthesis, for example, results indicated that the model was relatively insensitive to the choice of photosynthesis–irradiance curve, but markedly sensitive to the method of calculating light attenuation in the water column. The work highlights the utility of EMPOWER-1.0 as a means of comprehending, diagnosing and formulating equations for the dynamics of marine ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Abstract. This study presents FABM-PCLake, a redesigned structure of the PCLake aquatic ecosystem model, which we implemented in the Framework for Aquatic Biogeochemical Models (FABM). In contrast to the original model, which was designed for temperate, fully mixed freshwater lakes, the new FABM-PCLake represents an integrated aquatic ecosystem model that can be linked with different hydrodynamic models and allows simulations of hydrodynamic and biogeochemical processes for zero-dimensional, one-dimensional as well as three-dimensional environments. FABM-PCLake describes interactions between multiple trophic levels, including piscivorous, zooplanktivorous and benthivorous fish, zooplankton, zoobenthos, three groups of phytoplankton and rooted macrophytes. The model also accounts for oxygen dynamics and nutrient cycling for nitrogen, phosphorus and silicon, both within the pelagic and benthic domains. FABM-PCLake includes a two-way communication between the biogeochemical processes and the physics, where some biogeochemical state variables (e.g., phytoplankton) influence light attenuation and thereby the spatial and temporal distributions of light and heat. At the same time, the physical environment, including water currents, light and temperature influence a wide range of biogeochemical processes. The model enables studies on ecosystem dynamics in physically heterogeneous environments (e.g., stratifying water bodies, and water bodies with horizontal gradients in physical and biogeochemical properties), and through FABM also enables data assimilation and multi-model ensemble simulations. Examples of potential new model applications include climate change impact studies and environmental impact assessment scenarios for temperate, sub-tropical and tropical lakes and reservoirs.},

During the upwelling period of the southern Caribbean Sea (February–April), the d15N–PN is similar to that of the thermocline nitrate ( 3.5\%). This nitrate is imported into the Cariaco Basin with Subtropical Underwater (SUW), which wells up near the coast. Thus, particles generated by phytoplankton photosynthesis during this productive period bear a sub-tropical North Atlantic isotopic imprint of N2 ﬁxation (low compared to the global average of nitrate d15N E5\%). During the non-upwelling period when surface waters are stratiﬁed (September–November), the d15N–PN is also 3.5–4.0\%, and reﬂects a mixture of local N2 ﬁxation within the mixed layer, inputs of terrigenous organic matter and SUW nitrate consumption by phytoplankton below the mixed layer, which most likely exerts the strongest control on the d15N–PN signal during this time. In the transition periods of May–July and December–January, the d15N–PN increases to 4.5–6.5\%. This coincides with maxima of continental material ﬂuxes (terrestrial PON d15N is 4 6\%) into the Cariaco Basin. The d15N signal in the sediments of the Cariaco Basin thus provides information about the relative strength of the local coastal upwelling, the relative input of continental material via river runoff, and local N2 ﬁxation. The ﬁndings contribute to interpretations of the basin’s paleoclimatic nitrogen cycle variations based on observations of the sedimentary d15N record at this location.},

Since 1890, marine phytoplankton abundance has been assessed using a diverse range of sensors and observational platforms, and inter-calibrating these data have been challenging. Consequently, syntheses of historical phytoplankton data have been rarely attempted, and the need for accurate, long-term assessments of phytoplankton abundance and distribution is commonly acknowledged. Here, we derive quantitative indices of phytoplankton abundance from measurements of upper ocean transparency and color-calibrated with direct measurements of surface chlorophyll. The strong correlation and linear scaling of the predicted data enabled the construction of a comprehensive, globally intercalibrated chlorophyll time series from 1890 to 2010. The calibrated chlorophyll data reproduced the well-established spatial features of phytoplankton surface biomass and were strongly correlated with chlorophyll concentration derived from two independent remote sensing platforms discontinuously available since 1978. These results suggest that with careful statistical treatment it is possible to generate a globally integrated chlorophyll time series extending 120 years into the past. This database, which is available in the web appendices of this paper, may enable new insights in the areas of climate science, biogeochemical cycling, and marine ecosystem structure and functioning over the past century.},

First, we use a model of growth with ﬂexible stoichiometry to reexamine Rhee and Goldman’s classic chemostat data. We also discuss a recent data compilation by Hall and colleagues that illustrates some limits to phytoplankton ﬂexibility, and a model of physiological adaptation that can account for these results. Second, we use a model of resource allocation to determine the how the optimal nitrogen-tophosphorus stoichiometry depends on the ecological conditions under which species grow and compete. Third, we discuss Redﬁeld’s mechanism for the homeostasis of the oceans’ nitrogen-to-phosphorus stoichiometry and show its robustness to additional factors such as iron-limitation and temporal ﬂuctuations. Finally, we suggest areas for future research.},

	abstract = {Understanding the climatic drivers of eutrophication is critical for lake management under the prism of the global change. Yet the complex interplay between climatic variables and lake processes makes prediction of phytoplankton biomass a rather diﬃcult task. Quantifying the relative inﬂuence of climate-related variables on the regulation of phytoplankton biomass requires modelling approaches that use extensive ﬁeld measurements paired with accurate meteorological observations. In this study we used climate and lake related variables obtained from the ERA5-Land reanalysis dataset combined with a large dataset of in-situ measurements of chlorophyll-a and phytoplankton biomass from 50 water bodies to develop models of phytoplankton related responses as functions of the climate reanalysis data. We used chlorophyll-a and phytoplankton biomass as response metrics of phytoplankton growth and we employed two different modelling techniques, boosted regression trees (BRT) and generalized additive models for location scale and shape (GAMLSS). According to our results, the ﬁtted models had a relatively high explanatory power and predictive performance. Boosted regression trees had a high pseudo R2 with the type of the lake, the total layer temperature, and the mix-layer depth being the three predictors with the higher relative inﬂuence. The best GAMLSS model retained mix-layer depth, mix-layer temperature, total layer temperature, total runoff and 10-m wind speed as signiﬁcant predictors (p{\textless}0.001). Regarding the phytoplankton biomass both modelling approaches had less explanatory power than those for chlorophyll-a. Concerning the predictive performance of the models both the BRT and GAMLSS models for chlorophyll-a outperformed those for phytoplankton biomass. Overall, we consider these ﬁndings promising for future limnological studies as they bring forth new perspectives in modelling ecosystem responses to a wide range of climate and lake variables. As a concluding remark, climate reanalysis can be an extremely useful asset for lake research and management.},

            Phytoplankton play essential roles in marine food webs and global biogeochemical cycles, yet the responses of individual species and entire phytoplankton communities to anthropogenic climate change in the coming century remain uncertain. Here we map the biogeographies of commonly observed North Atlantic phytoplankton and compare their historical (1951–2000) and projected future ranges (2051–2100). We find that individual species and entire communities move in space, or shift, and that communities internally reassemble, or shuffle. Over the coming century, most but not all studied species shift northeastward in the basin, moving at a rate faster than previously estimated. These pronounced ecological changes are driven by dynamic changes in ocean circulation and surface conditions, rather than just warming temperatures alone.

              Anthropogenic climate change has shifted the biogeography and phenology of many terrestrial and marine species. Marine phytoplankton communities appear sensitive to climate change, yet understanding of how individual species may respond to anthropogenic climate change remains limited. Here, using historical environmental and phytoplankton observations, we characterize the realized ecological niches for 87 North Atlantic diatom and dinoflagellate taxa and project changes in species biogeography between mean historical (1951–2000) and future (2051–2100) ocean conditions. We find that the central positions of the core range of 74\% of taxa shift poleward at a median rate of 12.9 km per decade (km⋅dec
              −1
              ), and 90\% of taxa shift eastward at a median rate of 42.7 km⋅dec
              −1
              . The poleward shift is faster than previously reported for marine taxa, and the predominance of longitudinal shifts is driven by dynamic changes in multiple environmental drivers, rather than a strictly poleward, temperature-driven redistribution of ocean habitats. A century of climate change significantly shuffles community composition by a basin-wide median value of 16\%, compared with seasonal variations of 46\%. The North Atlantic phytoplankton community appears poised for marked shift and shuffle, which may have broad effects on food webs and biogeochemical cycles.},

Since then, several alternative hypotheses appeared focusing on the role of grazing and mixing processes such as turbulent convection or wind activity. Surprisingly, the role of community composition—and thus the distribution of phytoplankton traits—for bloom formation has not been addressed. Here, we discuss how trait variability between competing species might inﬂuence phytoplankton growth during the onset of the spring bloom. We hypothesize that the bloom will only occur if there are species with a combination of traits ﬁtting to the environmental conditions at the respective location and time. The basic traits for formation of the typical spring bloom are high growth rates and photoadaptation to low light conditions, but other traits such as nutrient kinetics and grazing resistance might also be important. We present concise ideas on how to test our theoretical considerations experimentally. Furthermore, we suggest that future models of phytoplankton blooms should include both water column dynamics and variability of phytoplankton traits to make realistic projections instead of treating the phytoplankton bloom as an aggregate community phenomenon.},

              Over the past several decades, global warming has been linked to shifts in the distributions and abundances of species. In the southern North Sea, temperatures have increased in the last three decades and this will likely have consequences on the seasonality of marine organisms living in the area. Ctenophores such as
              Beroe gracilis
              and
              Pleurobrachia pileus
              could be particularly affected by changes in their own phenology and that of their prey, thus causing shifts in ecosystem function. Despite their global relevance and their potentially deleterious effect on the fishing industry, only a few long‐term records of ctenophore abundance exist, and most of these records are semiquantitative in nature. Therefore, our knowledge of the influence of environmental factors on their population development is presently very limited. In this study, the long‐term abundance dynamics of
              B. gracilis, P. pileus
              and their food calanoid copepods were analysed for a highly temporally resolved time series in the German Bight at Helgoland Roads. Special attention was focused on the response of these organisms to climate warming. Bayesian statistics showed that the phenology of the two ctenophores shifted in a step‐like mode in the year 1987/1988 to permanent earlier appearances. The seasonal change in the population blooms of
              P. pileus
              and
              B. gracilis
              correlated remarkably well with a step‐like increase in winter and spring sea surface temperatures of the southern North Sea. Possible explanations for the changes observed in these organisms include higher reproductive rates, increased winter survival rates or both. Interannual variations in ctenophore abundances correlated best with the interannual changes in spring temperatures, although the impact of temperature on
              B. gracilis
              appeared less pronounced. The changes in copepods abundance were not consistent with changes in
              P. pileus
              and
              B. gracilis. P. pileus
              showed longer periods of high abundance after the permanent seasonal advancement. These longer periods were correlated with a decline in the average autumn abundance of copepods. Changes in the phenology of these organisms raise the concerns on the declining state of fish stocks, which could potentially be exacerbated by gelatinous zooplankton outbreaks. These conditions may ultimately lead to trophic dead ends by channelling the flow of energy away from higher trophic levels.},

The new mandala maps twelve response or effects traits, or environmental characteristics, related to different phytoplankton functional types: (1) relative preference for chemically reduced vs chemically oxidized forms of nitrogen; (2) relative availability of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus; (3) adaptation to high vs low light and the tendency to be autotrophic vs mixotrophic; (4) cell motility; (5) environmental turbulence; (6) pigmentation quality; (7) temperature; (8) cell size; (9) relative growth rate; (10) relative production of bioactive compounds such as toxins or reactive oxygen species (ROS); (11) r vs K strategy; and (12) fate of the production in terms of grazing. The new mandala serves to highlight the differences and trade-offs between traits and/or environmental conditions, and illustrates some traits tend to track each other, a concept that may be helpful in traitbased modeling approaches and in understanding environmental factors associated with harmful algal blooms. It is hoped that this new mandala captures some of our recent insight into phytoplankton physiology and functional traits, and has contemporary relevance in light of anthropogenic changes in nutrient form and ratio.},

Through exploration of data time series we develop a deﬁnition of a regime shift from a pragmatic perspective, in which a shift is considered as an abrupt change from a quantiﬁable ecosystem state. We conclude that such changes represent a restructuring of the ecosystem state in some substantial sense that persists for long enough that a new quasi-equilibrium state can be observed. The abruptness of the shift is relative to the life-scale or the reproductive time-scale of the higher predators that are inﬂuenced by the shift. In general, the event-forcing is external to the biological ecosystem, usually the physical climate system, but we also identify shifts that can be ascribed to anthropogenic forcing, in our examples ﬁshing. This pragmatic deﬁnition allows for several diﬀerent types of regime shift ranging from simple biogeographic shifts to nonlinear state changes. In practice it is quite diﬃcult to determine whether observed changes in an oceanic ecosystem are primarily spatial or temporally regulated. The determination of ecosystem state remains an unresolved, and imprecise, oceanographic problem.},

Here we studied, for the first time in the aquatic literature, the succession of marine plankton in the whole-plankton assemblage that spanned 5 orders of magnitude in size from microbes to macroplankton predators (not including fish or fish larvae, for which no consistent data were available). Samples were collected in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea (Bay of Villefranche) weekly during 10 months. Simultaneously collected samples were analyzed by flow cytometry, inverse microscopy, FlowCam, and ZooScan. The whole-plankton assemblage underwent sharp reorganizations that corresponded to bottom-up events of vertical mixing in the water-column, and its development was top-down controlled by large gelatinous filter feeders and predators. Based on the results provided by our novel whole-plankton assemblage approach, we propose a new comprehensive conceptual model of the annual plankton succession (i.e. whole plankton model) characterized by both stepwise stacking of four broad trophic communities from early spring through summer, which is a new concept, and progressive replacement of ecological plankton categories within the different trophic communities, as recognised traditionally.},

Although the nature of the pelagic habitat and the main phytoplankton taxa and ecology are relatively similar in both marine and freshwater systems, the lines of research have evolved, at least in part, separately. We compare and contrast the approaches adopted in marine and freshwater ecosystems with respect to phytoplankton functional traits. We note differences in study goals relating to functional trait use that assess community assembly and those that relate to ecosystem processes and biogeochemical cycling that affect the type of characteristics assigned as traits to phytoplankton taxa. Speciﬁc phytoplankton traits relevant for ecological function are examined in relation to herbivory, amplitude of environmental change and spatial and temporal scales of study. Major differences are identiﬁed, including the shorter time scale for regular environmental change in freshwater ecosystems compared to that in the open oceans as well as the type of sampling done by researchers based on site-accessibility. Overall, we encourage researchers to better motivate why they apply trait-based analyses to their studies and to make use of process-driven approaches, which are more common in marine studies. We further propose fully comparative trait studies conducted along the habitat gradient spanning freshwater to brackish to marine systems, or along geographic gradients. Such studies will beneﬁt from the combined strength of both ﬁelds.},

	abstract = {The global decline of biodiversity caused by human domination of ecosystems worldwide is supposed to alter important process rates and state variables in these ecosystems. However, there is considerable debate on the prevalence and importance of biodiversity effects on ecosystem function (BDEF). Here, we argue that much of the debate stems from two major shortcomings. First, most studies do not directly link the traits leading to increased or decreased function to the traits needed for species coexistence and dominance. We argue that implementing a trait-based approach and broadening the perception of diversity to include trait dissimilarity or trait divergence will result in more realistic predictions on the consequences of altered biodiversity. Second, the empirical and theoretical studies do not reﬂect the complexity of natural ecosystems, which makes it difﬁcult to transfer the results to natural situations of species loss. We review how different aspects of complexity (trophic structure, multifunctionality, spatial or temporal heterogeneity, and spatial population dynamics) alter our perception of BDEF. We propose future research avenues concisely testing whether acknowledging this complexity will strengthen the observed biodiversity effects. Finally, we propose that a major future task is to disentangle biodiversity effects on ecosystem function from direct changes in function due to human alterations of abiotic constraints.},

	abstract = {Among phytoplankton the diatoms are strong competitors and contribute significantly to total global primary production. Aspects of their life history, notably their high sinking rates, make them important to the export flux of carbon into the ocean interior. Unlike the majority of other phytoplankton, they utilize silicic acid (=silicate) to construct their cell walls and are controlled by its availability and distribution. Here a simple model is developed to study the relationship between the diatoms and the ocean's silicon cycle. The ecological component of this model pits the slightly superior diatoms against all other algae, with both groups competing for phosphate while the diatoms additionally require silicic acid. The model agrees reasonably with observed distributions of nutrients and with their biogeochemical fluxes. While theoretically superior, the diatoms are held in check by the availability of silicic acid, allowing the persistence and numerical dominance of the other algae. The concentrations of both nutrients are homeostatically controlled by the phytoplankton, and resist perturbations. Analysis finds that primary production in the model is ultimately controlled by phosphate, with silicic acid abundance controlling the fraction of the total produced by diatoms. Sensitivity analyses using more ecologically detailed variants of the model find that these results are generally robust. The model's treatment of the “silica pump” hypothesis [

This system extends from 61–75.51W and 10–12.51N, with 21 upwelling foci clustered in seven groups differentiated by their SST cycles. Two of those groups had the strongest coastal upwelling: the ‘eastern area’ (63–651W) and the ‘western area’ (70–731W). The literature reports that the eastern and western upwelling areas hold 78\% and 18\% of the small pelagic biomass within the upwelling system, respectively. We looked into variations of the upwelling dynamics in those areas using seasonal cycles of satellite SST, chlorophyll-a (Chl) and sea-wind, as well as climatological hydrographic data from the World Ocean Atlas. Comparing their annual averages, the eastern area featured the lowest SST (25.24 1C) and the highest Chl (1.65 mg m−3); it has moderate wind intensity (6.12 m s−1) and shallower 22 1C isotherm (85 m). The western area had stronger winds (8.23 m s−1) but deeper 22 1C isotherm (115 m), slightly higher SST (25.53 1C) and moderate Chl (1.15 mg m−3). The upwelling in the eastern area was more prolonged than in the western area (SST o26 1C during 8.5 and 6.9 months, respectively). According to the ‘optimal environmental window’ theory, small clupeoid recruitment is a dome-shaped function of the upwelling intensity, turbulence and SST, with an optimum wind speed around 5–6 m s−1. The eastern upwelling area wind speed is close to this optimum value. The western upwelling area shows much higher wind speed that causes high level of turbulence and strong offshore transport that could hinder small pelagics recruitment in that area.},

Models describe phytoplankton functional types by a set of traits that determine their growth rates or fitness. Traits for functional types are often determined from observations on a small number of species under laboratory conditions. Functional types can be composed of a large number of species with very different trait values, so the representation of a type by an average trait value may not be appropriate. A potential solution is to estimate trait values from observations of the aggregate biomass of phytoplankton functional types in natural populations. We report on some recent efforts to extract trait values from time-series data using Bayesian statistical models and discuss some challenges of this approach.},

	abstract = {The relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) and its consequence for ecosystem services has predominantly been studied by controlled, short-term and small-scale experiments under standardized environmental conditions and constant community compositions. However, changes in biodiversity occur in real-world ecosystems with varying environments and a dynamic community composition. In this theme issue, we present novel research on BEF in such dynamic communities. The contributions are organized in three sections on BEF relationships in (i) multi-trophic diversity, (ii) non-equilibrium biodiversity under disturbance and varying environmental conditions, and (iii) large spatial and long temporal scales. The first section shows that multi-trophic BEF relationships often appear idiosyncratic, while accounting for species traits enables a predictive understanding. Future BEF research on complex communities needs to include ecological theory that is based on first principles of species-averaged body masses, stoichiometry and effects of environmental conditions such as temperature. The second section illustrates that disturbance and varying environments have direct as well as indirect (via changes in species richness, community composition and species' traits) effects on BEF relationships. Fluctuations in biodiversity (species richness, community composition and also trait dominance within species) can severely modify BEF relationships. The third section demonstrates that BEF at larger spatial scales is driven by different variables. While species richness
              per se
              and community biomass are most important, species identity effects and community composition are less important than at small scales. Across long temporal scales, mass extinctions represent severe changes in biodiversity with mixed effects on ecosystem functions. Together, the contributions of this theme issue identify new research frontiers and answer some open questions on BEF relationships in dynamic communities of real-world landscapes.},

Data were obtained from about 60 species of nano-, micro-, and mesozooplankton, representing flagellates, ciliates, rotifers, meroplankton larvae, copepods, and cladocerans. Estimates of maximum ingestion and clearance were extracted from functional responses (ingestion rates as a function of food density) cstablishcd from laboratory experiments. Maximum specific rates were expressed as a function of predator body volume. Maximum specific clearance and ingestion rates decreased with predator volume within each group of zooplankton, with a-common exponent (scaling factor) of -0.23 (SE = 20.12) in accordance with previous findings. However, significant differences wcrc found between groups. In particular, among the protists, ciliates display maximum ingestion, growth, and clearance rates that exceed those of dinoflagellates by a factor of 2-4. Among the metazooplankton, Calanoid copepods have maximum clearance rates that cxcccd those of filter-feeding cladocerans and meroplankton larvae by a factor of 10. Because of these differenccs between the groups, the entire set of observations could not be fitted by an overall regression.},

In particular, we highlight a Mid Mesozoic Revolution in the nature and location of carbonate deposition in the marine environment, driven by the ecological success of calcareous plankton. This drove the creation of a responsive deep-sea sedimentary sink of CaCO3. The result is that biologically driven carbonate deposition provides a significant buffering of ocean chemistry and of atmospheric CO2 in the modern system. However, the same calcifying organisms that under-pin the deep-sea carbonate sink are now threatened by the continued atmospheric release of fossil fuel CO2 and increasing acidity of the surface ocean. We are not yet in a position to predict what the impact on CaCO3 production will be, or how the uptake of fossil fuel CO2 by the ocean will be affected. This uncertainty in the future trajectory of atmospheric CO2 that comes from incomplete understanding of the marine carbonate cycle is cause for concern.},

We ﬁnd a reproducible pattern of body sizedependence of day and night depths occupied, and of DVM. Both the smallest surface-dwelling and the largest deeper-dwelling copepods refrain from migrations, while intermediate-sized individuals show pronounced DVM. This pattern apparently arises as a consequence of size-dependent predation risk. In the size classes of migratory copepods the amplitude of DVM is further modulated by optical attenuation in the ocean water column because increased turbidity decreases encounter rates with visually hunting predators. Long-term changes in the ocean optical environment are expected to alter the vertical distributions of many copepods and thus to affect predator-prey encounters as well as oceanic carbon export.},

Consistency in the seasonal phasing of terrestrial plant activity provides a relatively low-noise background from which phenological shifts can be detected and attributed to climate change. Here, we ask whether phytoplankton biomass also fluctuates over a consistent annual cycle in lake, estuarine–coastal and ocean ecosystems and whether there is a characteristic phenology of phytoplankton as a consistent phase and amplitude of variability. We compiled 125 time series of phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll
              a
              concentration) from temperate and subtropical zones and used wavelet analysis to extract their dominant periods of variability and the recurrence strength at those periods. Fewer than half (48\%) of the series had a dominant 12-month period of variability, commonly expressed as the canonical spring-bloom pattern. About 20 per cent had a dominant six-month period of variability, commonly expressed as the spring and autumn or winter and summer blooms of temperate lakes and oceans. These annual patterns varied in recurrence strength across sites, and did not persist over the full series duration at some sites. About a third of the series had no component of variability at either the six- or 12-month period, reflecting a series of irregular pulses of biomass. These findings show that there is high variability of annual phytoplankton cycles across ecosystems, and that climate-driven annual cycles can be obscured by other drivers of population variability, including human disturbance, aperiodic weather events and strong trophic coupling between phytoplankton and their consumers. Regulation of phytoplankton biomass by multiple processes operating at multiple time scales adds complexity to the challenge of detecting climate-driven trends in aquatic ecosystems where the noise to signal ratio is high.},

	abstract = {The Eppley curve describes an exponential function that defines the maximum attainable daily growth rate of marine phytoplankton as a function of temperature. The curve was originally fitted by eye as the upper envelope of a data set, and despite its wide use, the reliability of this function has not been statistically tested. Our analysis of the data using quantile regression indicates that while the curve appears to be a good estimate of the edge of the data, it may not be reliable because the data set is small (n 5 162). We construct a contemporary, comprehensive data set (n 5 1,501) and apply an objective approach, quantile regression, to estimate its upper edge (99th quantile). This analysis yields a new predictive equation, mmax 5 0.81e0.0631T, that describes the maximum specific growth rates (mmax, d21) of marine phytoplankton as a function of temperature (T, uC). The Liverpool phytoplankton database (LPD) curve is higher than the Eppley curve across all temperatures, and at temperatures below 19uC, the Eppley curve falls below the lower 95\% confidence interval of the LPD curve. However, the LPD Q10 value (1.88) is identical to that of the Eppley curve and thus supports the use of models that incorporate this as an estimate of phytoplankton growth-rate response to temperature change. To assess the potential effect of the LPD curve on primary production, we embedded the LPD function into a one-dimensional numerical model of a temperate, pelagic ecosystem. This analysis suggests that models using the Eppley function will underestimate primary production by as much as 30\%.},

	abstract = {Trait-based approaches are an alternative to species-based approaches for functionally linking individual organisms with community structure and dynamics. In the trait-based approach, rather than focusing on the species identity of the organism, the focus is on the organism traits, which represent their physiological, morphological, or life-history characteristics. Although used in ecological research for several decades, this approach only emerged in ecological modelling about twenty years ago. We review this rise of trait-based models and trace the occasional transfer of traitbased modelling concepts between terrestrial plant ecology, animal and microbial ecology, and aquatic ecology, discuss terminology of trait-based approaches and evaluate future implementation of trait-based models, including cross-discipline exchange. Trait-based models have a variety of purposes, such as predicting changes in community patterns under climate and land-use change, understand underlying mechanisms for community assemblies, planning and assessing conservation management, or studying invasion processes. In modelling, trait-based approaches can reduce technical challenges such as computational limitations, scaling problems, and data scarcity. However, we note inconsistencies in the current usage of terms in trait-based approaches and these inconsistencies must be resolved if traitbased concepts are to be easily exchanged between disciplines. Specifically, future trait-based models may further benefit from incorporating intraspecific trait variability and addressing more complex species interactions. We also recommend expanding the combination of trait-based approaches with individual-based modelling to simplify the parameterization of models, to capture plant-plant interactions at the individual level, and to explain community dynamics under global change.},

We explore why these shortcomings exist and how to enable the global modelling community to increase MEMs’ usefulness. We identify a clear gap between proposed solutions to assess model skills, uncertainty, and confidence and their actual systematic deployment. We attribute this gap to an underlying factor that the ecosystem modelling literature largely ignores: technical issues.

A simple conceptual model was then developed to infer in situ phytoplankton carbon as a function of chlorophyll a. This allowed indirect estimates of the carbon-to-chlorophyll ratio of phytoplankton in the sea. Using data from high-performance liquid chromatography, field samples dominated by diatoms, dinoflagellates, green algae, prymnesiophytes and cyanobacteria were identified, and their carbon-to-chlorophyll ratios were established. The computations yielded conservative estimates for the ratio (15 to 176 weight:weight). The results were applied to satellite data to map the carbon-to-chlorophyll ratios in the NW Atlantic. Since methods were already in place to estimate photosynthesis–irradiance parameters for the region by remote sensing (Platt et al. 2008), we showed that it was possible, using remote sensing, to compute carbon-based phytoplankton growth rates by making use of the existing information on photosynthesis–irradiance parameters and carbonto-chlorophyll ratios. The method makes it possible to compute primary production by using either carbon-based growth models or photosynthesis–irradiance models in ways that are fully comparable with each other.},

	abstract = {Predators’ switching towards the most abundant prey is a mechanism that stabilizes population dynamics and helps overcome competitive exclusion of species in food webs. Current formulations of active prey-switching, however, display non-maximal feeding in which the predators’ total ingestion decays exponentially with the number prey species (i.e. the diet breadth) even though the total prey biomass stays constant. We analyse three previously published multi-species functional responses which have either active switching or maximal feeding, but not both. We identify the cause of this apparent incompatibility and describe a kill-the-winner formulation that combines active switching with maximal feeding. Active switching is shown to be a community response in which some predators become preyselective and the formulations with maximal or non-maximal feeding are implicitly assuming different food web conﬁgurations. Global simulations using a marine ecosystem model with 64 phytoplankton species belonging to 4 major functional groups show that the species richness and biogeography of phytoplankton are very sensitive to the choice of the functional response for grazing. The phytoplankton biogeography reﬂects the balance between the competitive abilities for nutrient uptake and the degree of apparent competition which occurs indirectly between species that share a common predator species. The phytoplankton diversity signiﬁcantly increases when active switching is combined with maximal feeding through predator-mediated coexistence.},

The performances of Redﬁeld–Monod and variable stoichiometric models are compared with theoretical expectations and experimental data for descriptions of multi-nutrient limited phytoplankton growth and predator–prey interactions. Serious deﬁciencies are revealed in Redﬁeld–Monod implementations; such constructs have outputs and/or structural logic contrary to empirical biological knowledge. For example, Redﬁeld–Monod models often employ nutrient limitation as a signiﬁcant factor controlling phytoplankton growth, and yet biologically such nutrient limitation is associated with signiﬁcant variation in elemental stoichiometry. One could argue that reliance on such dysfunctional descriptions is unacceptable, especially in an era when increasing political play is made of model simulations and predictions. Biological studies should examine the consumption and fate of all major nutrients, not just of the limiting nutrient, in order to furnish modellers with the mechanistic understanding, and data, to enable a reﬁned description of the organisms responsible for biogeochemical cycling. Modellers, in turn, should embrace existing experimental and phenomenological observations and update their models accordingly. Simpliﬁcations in model structure can then be made from a sound knowledge base rather than by making potentially incorrect a priori assumptions.},

Rapid compositional change is prevalent, with marine biomes exceeding and terrestrial biomes trailing the overall trend. Assemblage richness is not changing on average, although locations exhibiting increasing and decreasing trends of up to about 20\% per year were found in some marine studies. At local scales, widespread compositional reorganization is most often decoupled from richness change, and biodiversity change is strongest and most variable in the oceans.},

Realizing that biodiversity might inﬂuence the adaptation potential, recent model approaches have identiﬁed bottomup controls on patterns of phytoplankton diversity regulated by nutrient availability and seasonality. Top-down control of biodiversity, however, has not been considered in depth in such models. Here we demonstrate how zooplankton predation with prey-ratio based food preferences can enhance phytoplankton diversity in a ecosystem-circulation model with self-assembling community structure. Simulated diversity increases more than threefold under preferential grazing relative to standard density-dependent predation, and yields better agreement with observed distributions of phytoplankton diversity. The variable grazing pressure creates refuges for less competitive phytoplankton types, which reduces exclusion and improves the representation of seasonal phytoplankton succession during blooms. The type of grazing parameterization also has a signiﬁcant impact on primary and net community production. Our results demonstrate how a simple parameterization of a zooplankton community response affects simulated phytoplankton community structure, diversity and dynamics, and motivates development of more detailed representations of top-down processes essential for investigating the role of diversity in marine ecosystems.},

                  There are tens of thousands of species of phytoplankton found throughout the tree of life. Despite this diversity, phytoplankton are often aggregated into a few functional groups according to metabolic traits or biogeochemical role. We investigate the extent to which phytoplankton species dynamics are neutral within functional groups.
                
                
                  Seasonal dynamics in many regions of the ocean are known to affect phytoplankton at the functional group level leading to largely predictable patterns of seasonal succession. It is much more difficult to make general statements about the dynamics of individual species.
                
                
                  We use a 7‐year time series at station L4 in the Western English Channel with 57 diatom and 17 dinoflagellate species enumerated weekly to test whether the abundance of diatom and dinoflagellate species varies randomly within their functional group envelope or whether each species is driven uniquely by external factors.
                
                
                  We show that the total biomass of the diatom and dinoflagellate functional groups is well predicted by irradiance and temperature and quantify trait values governing the growth rate of both functional groups. The biomass dynamics of the functional groups are not neutral and each has their own distinct responses to environmental forcing. Compared to dinoflagellates, diatoms have faster growth rates and grow faster under lower irradiance, cooler temperatures, and higher nutrient conditions.
                
                
                  The biomass of most species varies randomly within their functional group biomass envelope, most of the time. As a consequence, modellers will find it difficult to predict the biomass of most individual species. Our analysis supports the approach of using a single set of traits for a functional group and suggests that it should be possible to determine these traits from natural communities.},

Crossing the threshold would lead to a much higher global average temperature than any interglacial in the past 1.2 million years and to sea levels significantly higher than at any time in the Holocene. We examine the evidence that such a threshold might exist and where it might be. If the threshold is crossed, the resulting trajectory would likely cause serious disruptions to ecosystems, society, and economies. Collective human action is required to steer the Earth System away from a potential threshold and stabilize it in a habitable interglacial-like state. Such action entails stewardship of the entire Earth System—biosphere, climate, and societies—and could include decarbonization of the global economy, enhancement of biosphere carbon sinks, behavioral changes, technological innovations, new governance arrangements, and transformed social values.},

	abstract = {Modeling of continuous systems gives a set of differential and algebraic equations. In order to utilize explicit integration routines, the highest order derivatives must be solved for. In certain cases there exist algebraic loops, i.e., subsets of the equations must be solved simultaneously. The dependency structures of such subsets are often sparse. In such cases, the solution may be found more efficiently by a technique called tearing (Kron 1963) which reduces the dimensions of subsystems. This paper gives an overview of the principles of tearing. Algorithms to determine how a set of equations should be torn are, in general, inefficient. However, physical insight often suggests how this should be done. Methods to specify tearing in the object-oriented modeling program Dymola (Elmqvist 1978, 1994) are discussed. In particular it is explained, how tearing can be defined in model libraries. This allows Dymola to perform tearing automatically and efficiently without user interaction. Examples from electrical and mechanical modeling are given, including a tearing strategy for general multibody systems with kinematic loops which allow the equations of motion to be solved by standard explicit integration algorithms.},

	abstract = {The Marine Biogeochemistry Library (MARBL) is a prognostic ocean biogeochemistry model that simulates marine ecosystem dynamics and the coupled cycles of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, iron, silicon, and oxygen. MARBL is a component of the Community Earth System Model (CESM); it supports flexible ecosystem configuration of multiple phytoplankton and zooplankton functional types; it is also portable, designed to interface with multiple ocean circulation models. Here, we present scientific documentation of MARBL, describe its configuration in CESM2 experiments included in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project version 6 (CMIP6), and evaluate its performance against a number of observational data sets. The model simulates present-day air-sea CO2 flux and many aspects of the carbon cycle in good agreement with observations. However, the simulated integrated uptake of anthropogenic CO2 is weak, which we link to poor thermocline ventilation, a feature evident in simulated chlorofluorocarbon distributions. This also contributes to larger-than-observed oxygen minimum zones. Moreover, radiocarbon distributions show that the simulated circulation in the deep North Pacific is extremely sluggish, yielding extensive oxygen depletion and nutrient trapping at depth. Surface macronutrient biases are generally positive at low latitudes and negative at high latitudes. CESM2 simulates globally integrated net primary production (NPP) of 48 Pg C yr−1 and particulate export flux at 100 m of 7.1 Pg C yr−1. The impacts of climate change include an increase in globally integrated NPP, but substantial declines in the North Atlantic. Particulate export is projected to decline globally, attributable to decreasing export efficiency associated with changes in phytoplankton community composition.},

	abstract = {Ocean acidiﬁcation from the uptake of anthropogenic carbon is simulated for the industrial period and IPCC SRES emission scenarios A2 and B1 with a global coupled carbon cycle-climate model. Earlier studies identiﬁed seawater saturation state with respect to aragonite, a mineral phase of calcium carbonate, as a key variable governing impacts on corals and other shell-forming organisms. Globally in the A2 scenario, water saturated by more than 300\%, considered suitable for coral growth, vanishes by 2070 AD (CO2≈630 ppm), and the ocean volume fraction occupied by saturated water decreases from 42\% to 25\% over this century. The largest simulated pH changes worldwide occur in Arctic surface waters, where hydrogen ion concentration increases by up to 185\% (1pH=−0.45). Projected climate change ampliﬁes the decrease in Arctic surface mean saturation and pH by more than 20\%, mainly due to freshening and increased carbon uptake in response to sea ice retreat. Modeled saturation compares well with observation-based estimates along an Arctic transect and simulated changes have been corrected for remaining model-data differences in this region. Aragonite undersaturation in Arctic surface waters is projected to occur locally within a decade and to become more widespread as atmospheric CO2 continues to grow. The results imply that surface waters in the Arctic Ocean will become corrosive to aragonite, with potentially large implications for the marine ecosystem, if anthropogenic carbon emissions are not reduced and atmospheric CO2 not kept below 450 ppm.},

                    Recent studies clearly support a positive biodiversity–ecosystem functioning (
                    BEF
                    ) relationship in phytoplankton. As taxon richness does not quantify functional diversity, functional approaches have been developed to link community functioning to diversity. Compared to terrestrial plant communities, only a few studies have validated phytoplankton functional approaches in
                    BEF
                    relationships. Furthermore, the ability of functional and taxonomic richness measures in predicting ecosystem functioning of natural phytoplankton communities has not been compared yet.
                  
                
                
                  
                    Here, we analysed the
                    BEF
                    relationship using taxonomic and functional (trait categories and response groups
                    sensu
                    Reynolds) approaches in a broad‐scale phytoplankton dataset from Fennoscandia. First, we analysed how taxonomic and functional compositions were related to local environmental predictors. We then compared how taxonomic and functional richness performed in predicting resource‐use efficiency (the yield in phytoplankton biomass standardised by total phosphorus) as an ecosystem functioning measure. Finally, we tested whether the relationship between ecosystem functioning and taxonomic richness is further enhanced once each of the functional richness measure is also considered.
                  
                
                
                  Among the approaches, phytoplankton functional trait categories as community matrix showed the best correspondence with the local environment. The richness of phytoplankton response groups predicted ecosystem functioning significantly better than the taxonomic and the functional trait category richness—both in the full dataset and in almost all Fennoscandian countries. On top of taxonomic richness, only the residual variation in response group richness predicted ecosystem functioning positively in the entire dataset and in all individual countries.
                
                
                  
                    Applying functional approaches, reduced complexity of data should come along with reduced ecological information. We showed, however, that both functional approaches represented some functional redundancy among taxa in a meaningful way, and enhanced our ability in predicting community composition from environmental predictors. Moreover, phytoplankton response group richness
                    sensu
                    Reynolds summarises information on ecosystem functioning contained in the taxonomic data in a way that represents functional diversity better than the richness of functional trait categories.
                  
                
                
                  Interestingly, the response group approach, which is exclusively derived from field observations rather than from quantified phytoplankton traits, outperforms taxonomic richness and trait category richness in predicting ecosystem functioning in our dataset. This may highlight that our ability to quantify phytoplankton traits is still limited. Existing phytoplankton functional approaches, however, can translate the taxonomic information into a reduced but reliable functional matrix already and predict ecosystem functioning better than taxonomic data.},

            John Steele (1926–2013) is remembered for his ecosystem modelling studies on the role of biological interactions and environment on the structure and function of marine ecosystems, including consequences for fish production and fisheries management. Here, we provide a scientific tribute to Steele focusing on, by means of example, his modelling of plankton predation [Steele and Henderson (1992) The role of predation in plankton models. J. Plankton Res., 14, 157–172] that showed that differences in ecosystem dynamics between the subarctic Pacific and North Atlantic oceans can be explained solely on the basis of zooplankton mortality. The study highlights Steele’s artistry in simplifying the system to a tractable minimal model while paying great attention to the precise functional forms used to parameterize mortality, grazing and other biological processes. The success of this and other works by Steele was in large part due to his effective communication with the rest of the scientific community (especially non-modellers) resulting from his enthusiasm, use of an experiment-like (hypothesis driven) approach to applying his models and by describing simplifications and assumptions in scrupulous detail. We also intend our contribution to remember Steele as the consummate gentleman, notably his humble, behind-the-scenes attitude, his humour and his dedication to enhancing the careers of others.},

            Ocean warming occurs every year in seasonal cycles that can help us to understand long-term responses of plankton to climate change. Rhythmic seasonal patterns of microbial community turnover are revealed when high-resolution measurements of microbial plankton diversity are applied to samples collected in lengthy time series. Seasonal cycles in microbial plankton are complex, but the expansion of fixed ocean stations monitoring long-term change and the development of automated instrumentation are providing the time-series data needed to understand how these cycles vary across broad geographical scales. By accumulating data and using predictive modeling, we gain insights into changes that will occur as the ocean surface continues to warm and as the extent and duration of ocean stratification increase. These developments will enable marine scientists to predict changes in geochemical cycles mediated by microbial communities and to gauge their broader impacts.},

	abstract = {This paper focuses on the ecosystem regime shift in the North Sea that occurred during the period 1982–1988. The evidence for the change is seen from individual species to key ecosystem parameters such as diversity and from phytoplankton to ﬁsh. Although many biological/ecosystem parameters and individual species exhibited a stepwise change during the period 1983–1988, some indicators show no evidence of change. The cause of the regime shift is likely to be related to pronounced changes in large-scale hydro-meteorological forcing. This involved activating of complex intermediate physical mechanisms which explains why the exact timing of the shift can vary from 1982 to 1988 (centred around two periods: 1982–1985 and 1987–1988) according to the species or taxonomic group. Increased sea surface temperature and possibly change in wind intensity and direction at the end of the 1970s in the west European basin triggered a change in the location of an oceanic biogeographical boundary along the European continental shelf. This aﬀected both the stable and substrate biotope components of North Sea marine ecosystems (i.e. components related to the water masses and components which are geographically stable) circa 1984. Large-scale hydro-climatic forcing also modiﬁed local hydro-meteorological parameters around the North Sea after 1987 aﬀecting the stable biotope components of North Sea ecosystems. Problems related to the detection and quantiﬁcation of an ecosystem regime shift are discussed.},

Some of these methods are applied to a collection of ﬁshery oceanographic time series for the N.

One recommendation for future studies is to analyze biotic and abiotic time series separately in order to identify ecosystem state variables of interest and to better isolate ecosystem behaviors from other inﬂuences like environmental change. Methods that allow for quantitative assessments of the statistical signiﬁcance of hypothesized regime shifts should be favored over those that do not. Analyses of especially large collections of time series may beneﬁt from ﬁrst using a data compression technique and then applying one of the methods that are more appropriate for just one or a small number of time series. Because of the diﬃculties in observing and adequately documenting many aspects of marine ecosystem variability, it is crucial that future research attempt to combine empirical studies of large marine ecosystems with theoretical and modeling studies of other systems for which the dynamics and predictability are better understood. With such a comparative approach it should be possible to reﬁne conceptual and simulation models, while also identifying crucial gaps in existing observations.},

	abstract = {Environmental factors regulate biodiversity through species sorting processes. Species distributions in communities affect ecosystem processes and environmental factors. These dynamics are determined by the properties (traits) of species in the community. The optimal temperatures for growth, the minimal amount of resource that sustains positive mass balance, and the amount of energy allocated to predator defenses are examples of such traits. Over time, the trait distributions in communities may change in response to environmental changes, which, in turn, changes the processes and consequently the structure of the system. The result of such processes is the focus of complex adaptive systems (CAS) theory. This paper gives an overview of how CAS theory can contribute to understanding the role of biodiversity on the ability of functional groups that make up the ecosystem to change their species compositions in response to changes in the environment. Any trait that requires investment of energy, mass, or time is subjected to a tradeoff for alternative use of this resource. Such interspecies tradeoff relationships can be used to make predictions about past environmental conditions, as well as the response of the properties of a group of species, e.g., total productivity and species distributions, to future changes in the environment. The traitbased framework presented here makes explicit predictions regarding the relation between the environment, trait distributions, and ecosystem processes. Trait variance, a measure of the width of the distribution of traits in the community, is proportional to the rate at which species within functional groups can replace each other in response to environmental changes. This adaptive capacity is crucial for the ecosystem’s ability to maintain certain processes under times of change. Examples of empirical tradeoffs are given as well as how to formalize them to use in the CAS framework.},

            In the tropics, thermal stratification (during warm conditions) may contribute to a shallowing of the mixed layer above the nutricline and a reduction in the transfer of nutrients to the surface lit-layer, ultimately limiting phytoplankton growth. Using remotely sensed observations and modelled datasets, we study such linkages in the northern Red Sea (NRS) - a typical tropical marine ecosystem. We assess the interannual variability (1998–2015) of both phytoplankton biomass and phenological indices (timing of bloom initiation, duration and termination) in relation to regional warming. We demonstrate that warmer conditions in the NRS are associated with substantially weaker winter phytoplankton blooms, which initiate later, terminate earlier and are shorter in their overall duration ({\textasciitilde} 4 weeks). These alterations are directly linked with the strength of atmospheric forcing (air-sea heat fluxes) and vertical stratification (mixed layer depth [MLD]). The interannual variability of sea surface temperature (SST) is found to be a good indicator of phytoplankton abundance, but appears to be less important for predicting bloom timing. These findings suggest that future climate warming scenarios may have a two-fold impact on phytoplankton growth in tropical marine ecosystems: 1) a reduction in phytoplankton abundance and 2) alterations in the timing of seasonal phytoplankton blooms.},

Data were obtained from about 60 species of nano-, micro-, and mesozooplankton, representing flagellates, ciliates, rotifers, meroplankton larvae, copepods, and cladocerans. Estimates of maximum ingestion and clearance were extracted from functional responses (ingestion rates as a function of food density) cstablishcd from laboratory experiments. Maximum specific rates were expressed as a function of predator body volume. Maximum specific clearance and ingestion rates decreased with predator volume within each group of zooplankton, with a-common exponent (scaling factor) of -0.23 (SE = 20.12) in accordance with previous findings. However, significant differences wcrc found between groups. In particular, among the protists, ciliates display maximum ingestion, growth, and clearance rates that exceed those of dinoflagellates by a factor of 2-4. Among the metazooplankton, Calanoid copepods have maximum clearance rates that cxcccd those of filter-feeding cladocerans and meroplankton larvae by a factor of 10.

	abstract = {Modelers often need to quantify the rates at which zooplankton consume a variety of species, size classes and trophic types. Implicit in the equations used to describe the multiple resource functional response (i.e. how nutritional intake varies with resource densities) are assumptions that are not often stated, let alone tested. This is problematic because models are sensitive to the details of these formulations. Here, we enable modelers to make more informed decisions by providing them with a new frameworkfor considering zooplankton feeding on multiple resources. We deﬁne a new classiﬁcation of multiple resource responses that is based on preference, selection and switching, and we develop a set of mathematical diagnostics that elucidate model assumptions. We use these tools to evaluate the assumptions and biological dynamics inherent in published multiple resource responses. These models are shown to simulate different resource preferences, implied single resource responses, changes in intake with changing resource densities, nutritional beneﬁts of generalism, and nutritional costs of selection. Certain formulations are further shown to exhibit anomalous dynamics such as negative switching and sub-optimal feeding. Such varied responses can have vastly different ecological consequences for both zooplankton and their resources; inappropriate choices may incorrectly quantify biologicallymediated ﬂuxes and predict spurious dynamics. We discuss how our classes and diagnostics can help constrain parameters, interpret behaviors, and identify limitations to a formulation’s applicability for both regional (e.g. HighNitrate-Low-Chlorophyll regions comprising large areas of the Paciﬁc) and large-scale applications (e.g. global biogeochemical or climate change models).

Now that regional circulation patterns can be reasonably well reproduced by ocean circulation models, significant effort is being directed toward incorporating complex food webs into these models, many of which now routinely include multiple phytoplankton (P) and zooplankton (Z) compartments. This study quantitatively assesses how the number of phytoplankton and zooplankton compartments affects the ability of a lower-trophic-level ecosystem model to reproduce and predict observed patterns in surface chlorophyll and particulate organic carbon. Five ecosystem model variants are implemented in a one-dimensional assimilative (variational adjoint) model testbed in the Mid-Atlantic Bight. The five models are identical except for variations in the level of complexity included in the lower trophic levels, which range from a simple 1P1Z food web to a considerably more complex 3P2Z food web. The five models assimilated satellite-derived chlorophyll and particulate organic carbon concentrations at four continental shelf sites, and the resulting optimal parameters were tested at five independent sites in a cross-validation experiment. Although all five models showed improvements in model–data misfits after assimilation, overall the moderately complex 2P2Z model was associated with the highest model skill. Additional experiments were conducted in which 20\% random noise was added to the satellite data prior to assimilation. The 1P and 2P models successfully reproduced nearly identical optimal parameters regardless of whether or not noise was added to the assimilated data, suggesting that random noise inherent in satellite-derived data does not pose a significant problem to the assimilation of satellite data into these models. However, the most complex model tested (3P2Z) was sensitive to the level of random noise added to the data prior to assimilation, highlighting the potential danger of over-tuning inherent in such complex models.},

	title = {A chronology of plankton dynamics in silico: how computer models have been used to study marine ecosystems},
	abstract = {Research on plankton ecology in the oceans has traditionally been conducted via two scientiﬁc approaches: in situ (in the ﬁeld) and in vitro (in the laboratory). There is, however, a third approach: exploring plankton dynamics in silico, or using computer models as tools to study marine ecosystems. Models have been used for this purpose for over 60 years, and the innovations and implementations of historical studies provide a context for how future model applications can continue to advance our understanding. To that end, this paper presents a chronology of the in silico approach to plankton dynamics, beginning with modeling pioneers who worked in the days before computers. During the ﬁrst 30 years of automated computation, plankton modeling focused on formulations for biological processes and investigations of community structure. The changing technological context and conceptual paradigms of the late-1970s and 1980s resulted in simulations becoming more widespread research tools for biological oceanographers. This period saw rising use of models as hypothesis-testing tools, and means of exploring the effects of circulation on spatial distributions of organisms. Continued computer advances and increased availability of data in the 1990s allowed old approaches to be applied to old and new problems, and led to developments of new approaches. Much of the modeling in the new millennium so far has incorporated these sophistications, and many cutting-edge applications have come from a new generation of plankton scientists who were trained by modeling gurus of previous eras. The future directions for modeling plankton dynamics are rooted in the historical studies.},

To predict and assess these community shifts and their consequences, ecologists are increasingly investigating how the functional traits of plankton determine their relative ﬁtness along environmental and biological gradients. Laboratory, ﬁeld and modelling studies are adopting this trait-based approach to map the biogeography of plankton traits that underlies variations in plankton communities. Here, we review progress towards understanding the regulatory roles of several key plankton functional traits, including cell size, N2-ﬁxation and mixotrophy among phytoplankton, and body size, ontogeny and feeding behaviour for zooplankton. The trait biogeographical approach sheds light on what structures plankton communities in the current ocean, as well as under climate change scenarios, and also allows for ﬁner resolution of community function because community trait composition determines the rates of signiﬁcant processes, including carbon export. Although understanding of trait biogeography is growing, uncertainties remain that stem, in part, from the paucity of observations describing plankton functional traits. Thus, in addition to recommending widespread adoption of the trait-based approach, we advocate for enhanced collection, standardisation and dissemination of plankton functional trait data.},

Signiﬁcant progress will be facilitated by adopting a coherent theoretical framework comprised of three elements: an underlying trait distribution, a performance ﬁlter deﬁning the ﬁtness of traits in different environments, and a dynamic projection of the performance ﬁlter along some environmental gradient. This framework allows changes in the trait distribution and associated modiﬁcations to community composition or ecosystem function to be predicted across time or space. The structure and dynamics of the performance ﬁlter specify two key criteria by which we judge appropriate quantitative methods for testing traits-based hypotheses. Bayesian multilevel models, dynamical systems models and hybrid approaches meet both these criteria and have the potential to meaningfully advance traits-based ecology.},

	abstract = {Although predator–prey cycles can be easily predicted with mathematical models it is only since recently that oscillations observed in a chemostat predator–prey (rotifer–algal) experiment offer an interesting workbench for testing model soundness. These new observations have highlighted the limitations of the conventional modelling approach in correctly reproducing some unexpected characteristics of the cycles. Simulations are improved when changes in algal community structure, resulting from natural selection operating on an assemblage of algal clones differing in competitive ability and defence against rotifer predation, is considered in multi-prey models. This approach, however, leads to extra complexity in terms of state variables and parameters. We show here that multi-prey models with one predator can be effectively approximated with a simpler (only a few differential equations) model derived in the context of adaptive dynamics and obtained with a moment-based approximation. The momentbased approximation has been already discussed in the literature but mostly in a theoretical context, therefore we focus on the strength of this approach in downscaling model complexity by relating it to the chemostat predator–prey experiment. Being based on mechanistic concepts, our modelling framework can be applied to any community of competing species for which a trade-off between competitive ability and resistance to predators can be appropriately deﬁned. We suggest that this approach can be of great beneﬁt for reducing complexity in biogeochemical modelling studies at the basin or global ocean scale.},

From a conceptual perspective, there is a need to develop theories and hypotheses about the roles of these exchanges on different community and ecosystem attributes. Here we focus on the concept of metacommunities, to address how plankton communities are structured and how this may generate patterns of variation in planktonic ecosystems. Our premise is that planktonic systems can be understood in the framework of metacommunities and that the regulation of these metacommunities alter how they work as ‘‘complex adaptive systems.’’ We hypothesize that connectivity through dispersal of local communities that are embedded in aquatic metacommunities show a range of dynamic behaviors related to their capacity to respond adaptively to environmental change.},

	abstract = {As a first step toward the development of coupled, basin scale models of ocean circulation and biogeochemical cycling, we present a model of the annual cycles of plankton dynamics and nitrogen cycling in the oceanic mixed layer. The model is easily modified and runs in FORTRAN on a personal computer. In our initial development and exploration of the model's behavior we have concentrated on modeling the annual cycle at Station "S" near Bermuda using seven compartments (Phytoplankton, Zooplankton, Bacteria, Nitrate, Ammonium, Dissolved organic nitrogen and Detritus). This choice of compartments and the attendant flows (fluxes or intercompartmental exchanges) permits a functional distinction between new and regenerated production. We have examined over 200 different runs and carried out sensitivity analyses. Results of model runs with detrital sinking rates of I and 10 meters per day are presented. In these runs, the phytoplankton biomass-specific mortality rate was varied to adjust the annual net primary production (NPP) for the mixed layer to a value equivalent to 45 gC m-2, which was calculated from the literature. Modelled cycles of zooplankton and bacterial stocks, and magnitudes of their annual production which cannot be validated due to sparse observations, are driven by the amplitude of the spring bloom and by changes in foodweb structure. Most, but not all model runs exhibit a spring bloom triggered by the winter depression of zooplankton stocks and the vernal increase in solar irradiance. The bloom is driven by nitrate entrained into the mixed layer during the wintertime deepening of the mixed layer. Following the shoaling of the pycnocline to ca 20 m, nitrate supply is limited to diffusional inputs, nitrate stocks are depleted, and regenerated production exceeds new production. The resulting cycles of new and regenerated production produce an annual cycle of the f-ratio with winter maxima approaching 0.8-0.9 and summer minima reaching ca 0.1-0.2, with annual values averaging 0.7. The model reproduces the "Eppley Curve," a hyperbolic relationship of increasing f with increasing primary production. This curve is shown to be the trajectory of the production system in the f-NPP phase plane. These model runs reproduce the annual cycles of areal NPP, and average annual NPP, new production, and particulate N flux values reported in the literature. The model demonstrates that currently accepted values for these annual fluxes can be reconciled only if the f-ratio has a high annual average. At present, the annual averagef-ratio is poorly quantified due to severe undersampling in fall and winter. Our model's ecological structure has been successfully incorporated into the Princeton general circulation model for the North Atlantic Ocean.},

Some theories claim smaller organisms can grow faster following a resource pulse, whereas others argue larger species can accumulate more resources and maintain growth for longer periods between resource pulses. Testing these theories has relied on interspecific comparisons, which tend to confound body size with other life-history traits. As a more direct approach, we used 280 generations of artificial selection to evolve a 10-fold difference in mean body size between small- and large-selected phytoplankton lineages of
              Dunaliella tertiolecta
              , while controlling for biotic and abiotic variables. We then quantified how body size affected the ability of this species to grow at nutrient-replete conditions and following periods of nitrogen or phosphorous deprivation. Overall, smaller cells showed slower growth, lower storage capacity and poorer recovery from phosphorous depletion, as predicted by the ‘fasting endurance hypothesis'. However, recovery from nitrogen limitation was independent of size—a finding unanticipated by current theories. Phytoplankton species are responsible for much of the global carbon fixation and projected trends of cell size decline could reduce primary productivity by lowering the ability of a cell to store resources.},

These two resources were exploited with an existing, statistically consistent method built upon evolutionary concepts. From a new data set with {\textgreater}700 observations on freshwater phytoplankton traits and a qualitative phytoplankton phylogeny, estimates were derived for the size, growth rate, phosphate affinity, and susceptibility to predation of 277 phytoplankton types, from evolutionary ancestors to present‐day species. These estimates account simultaneously for phylogenetic relationships between types, as imposed by the phylogeny, and approximate power‐law relationships (e.g., allometric scaling laws) between traits, as reconstructed from the data set. Results suggest that most phytoplankton traits are to some extent conserved in evolution: cross‐validation demonstrated that the use of phylogenetic information significantly improves trait value estimates. By providing trait value estimates as well as uncertainties, these results could benefit most quantitative studies involving phytoplankton.},

In contrast, regional hotspots where changepoints occur frequently largely disappeared. Heterotrophy and larger organism sizes were associated with more changepoints.

	abstract = {Significance
            Phytoplankton provide the energy that sustains marine fish populations. The relationship between phytoplankton productivity and fisheries catch, however, is complicated by uncertainty in catch estimates, fishing effort, and marine food web dynamics. We enlist global data sources and a high-resolution earth system model to address these uncertainties. Results show that cross-ecosystem fisheries catch differences far exceeding differences in phytoplankton production can be reconciled with fishing effort and variations in marine food web structure and energy transfer efficiency. Food web variations explaining contemporary fisheries catch act to amplify projected catch trends under climate change, suggesting catch changes that may exceed a factor of 2 for some regions. Failing to account for this would hinder adaptation to climate change.
          , 
            
              Photosynthesis fuels marine food webs, yet differences in fish catch across globally distributed marine ecosystems far exceed differences in net primary production (NPP). We consider the hypothesis that ecosystem-level variations in pelagic and benthic energy flows from phytoplankton to fish, trophic transfer efficiencies, and fishing effort can quantitatively reconcile this contrast in an energetically consistent manner. To test this hypothesis, we enlist global fish catch data that include previously neglected contributions from small-scale fisheries, a synthesis of global fishing effort, and plankton food web energy flux estimates from a prototype high-resolution global earth system model (ESM). After removing a small number of lightly fished ecosystems, stark interregional differences in fish catch per unit area can be explained (
              r
              = 0.79) with an energy-based model that (
              i
              ) considers dynamic interregional differences in benthic and pelagic energy pathways connecting phytoplankton and fish, (
              ii
              ) depresses trophic transfer efficiencies in the tropics and, less critically, (
              iii
              ) associates elevated trophic transfer efficiencies with benthic-predominant systems. Model catch estimates are generally within a factor of 2 of values spanning two orders of magnitude. Climate change projections show that the same macroecological patterns explaining dramatic regional catch differences in the contemporary ocean amplify catch trends, producing changes that may exceed 50\% in some regions by the end of the 21st century under high-emissions scenarios. Models failing to resolve these trophodynamic patterns may significantly underestimate regional fisheries catch trends and hinder adaptation to climate change.},

	abstract = {Nutrient utilization traits can be used to link the ecophysiology of phytoplankton to population dynamic models and the structure of communities across environmental gradients. Here we analyze a comprehensive literature compilation of four traits: maximum nutrient uptake rate; the half-saturation constant for nutrient uptake; the minimum subsistence quota, measured for nitrate and phosphate; and maximum growth rate. We also use these traits to analyze two composite traits, uptake affinity and scaled uptake affinity. All traits tend to increase with cell volume, except for scaled uptake affinity and maximum growth rate, which tend to decline with cell volume. Most scaling relationships are the same for freshwater and marine species, although important differences exist. Most traits differ on average between major taxa, but between-taxon variation is nearly always due to between-taxon variation in volume. There is some evidence for between-trait correlations that could constrain trait evolution, but these correlations are difficult to disentangle from correlation driven by cell volume. These results should enhance the parameterization of models that use size or taxonomic group to structure physiological variation in phytoplankton communities.},

At the ecosystem level, warming has the capacity to alter the structure of communities and the rates of key ecosystem processes they mediate. Here we assessed the effects of a 4°C rise in temperature on the size structure and taxonomic composition of benthic communities in aquatic mesocosms, and the rates of detrital decomposition they mediated. Warming had no effect on biodiversity, but altered community size structure in two ways. In spring, warmer systems exhibited steeper size spectra driven by declines in total community biomass and the proportion of large organisms. By contrast, in autumn, warmer systems had shallower size spectra driven by elevated total community biomass and a greater proportion of large organisms. Community-level shifts were mirrored by changes in decomposition rates. Temperature-corrected microbial and macrofaunal decomposition rates reflected the shifts in community structure and were strongly correlated with biomass across mesocosms. Our study demonstrates that the 4°C rise in temperature expected by the end of the century has the potential to alter the structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems profoundly, as well as the intimate linkages between these levels of ecological organization.},

Global satellite studies have primarily focused on chlorophyll concentration and net primary production (NPP) to understand the role of phytoplankton in these processes. Recent satellite retrievals of phytoplankton composition now allow for the size of phytoplankton cells to be considered. Here we improve understanding of phytoplankton size structure impacts on particle export, remineralization, and transfer. A global compilation of particulate organic carbon (POC) ﬂux estimated from sediment traps and 234Th are utilized. Annual climatologies of NPP, percent microplankton, and POC ﬂux at four time series locations and within biogeochemical provinces are constructed. Parameters that characterize POC ﬂux versus depth (export ﬂux ratio, labile fraction, and remineralization length scale) are ﬁt for time series locations, biogeochemical provinces, and times of the year dominated by small and large phytoplankton cells where phytoplankton cell size show enough dynamic range over the annual cycle. Considering all data together, our ﬁndings support the idea of high export ﬂux but low transfer efﬁciency in productive regions and vice versa for oligotrophic regions. However, when parsing by dominant size class, we ﬁnd periods dominated by small cells to have both greater export ﬂux efﬁciency and lower transfer efﬁciency than periods when large cells comprise a greater proportion of the phytoplankton community.},

            Our understanding on phytoplankton diversity has largely been progressing since the publication of Hutchinson on the paradox of the plankton. In this paper, we summarise some major steps in phytoplankton ecology in the context of mechanisms underlying phytoplankton diversity. Here, we provide a framework for phytoplankton community assembly and an overview of measures on taxonomic and functional diversity. We show how ecological theories on species competition together with modelling approaches and laboratory experiments helped understand species coexistence and maintenance of diversity in phytoplankton. The non-equilibrium nature of phytoplankton and the role of disturbances in shaping diversity are also discussed. Furthermore, we discuss the role of water body size, productivity of habitats and temperature on phytoplankton species richness, and how diversity may affect the functioning of lake ecosystems. At last, we give an insight into molecular tools that have emerged in the last decades and argue how it has broadened our perspective on microbial diversity. Besides historical backgrounds, some critical comments have also been made.},

            Despite their importance to ocean productivity, global patterns of marine phytoplankton diversity remain poorly characterized. Although temperature is considered a key driver of general marine biodiversity, its specific role in phytoplankton diversity has remained unclear. We determined monthly phytoplankton species richness by using niche modeling and {\textgreater}540,000 global phytoplankton observations to predict biogeographic patterns of 536 phytoplankton species. Consistent with metabolic theory, phytoplankton richness in the tropics is about three times that in higher latitudes, with temperature being the most important driver. However, below 19°C, richness is lower than expected, with {\textasciitilde}8°– 14°C waters ({\textasciitilde}35° to 60° latitude) showing the greatest divergence from theoretical predictions. Regions of reduced richness are characterized by maximal species turnover and environmental variability, suggesting that the latter reduces species richness directly, or through enhancing competitive exclusion. The nonmonotonic relationship between phytoplankton richness and temperature suggests unanticipated complexity in responses of marine biodiversity to ocean warming.},

	abstract = {The Shannon index of diversity H′ is a commonly used metric in ecology. The tendency of this index to show a unimodal relationship with productivity has been the subject of several studies. In the present work, the behavior of H′ and three related ecological indices (Simpson, Hill, and Evenness) was investigated using phytoplankton assemblages along a eutrophication gradient. We used both natural and simulated assemblages, whereby the comparison enabled us to assess the role of environmental ‘noise’ on index behavior. We developed simulated assemblages based on phytoplankton distributions predicted by two model types: the log series statistical model and the random fraction niche-based model. Using ﬁeld data, H′ and the related Simpson index showed expected unimodal relationships with eutrophication. The same unimodal relationships were reproduced with simulated assemblages. Comparing the simulations with natural assemblages along a eutrophication gradient showed that there was much unexplained variance in the real-world data, suggesting that these diversity indices are sensitive to stochastic processes. An analysis of the simulated assemblages using relative abundance distributions suggested that increasing H′ and Simpson index values in the low range of the eutrophication gradient were due to increasing species richness, and that decreasing index values in the high range of the eutrophication gradient were due to decreasing evenness. In addition, this analysis revealed how assemblages of identical H′ values arose from contrasting community structures found in the low- and high-range of eutrophication. The high variability and non-linearity of the Shannon and Simpson indices along a eutrophication gradient suggests that these measures of diversity are inappropriate for use as water quality monitoring assessment tools. Indeed, when calculating ecological quality ratios that are employed by the European Water Framework Directive, unreliable (non-monotonic) predictions of water quality resulted.},

We projected indicator trends to 2020 using an adaptive statistical framework that incorporated the specific properties of individual time series. On current trajectories, results suggest that despite accelerating policy and management responses to the biodiversity crisis, the impacts of these efforts are unlikely to be reflected in improved trends in the state of biodiversity by 2020.

	abstract = {Surface-tethered particle interceptor traps (PITs) were deployed at 50 and 100 m (1–3 days) on ten occasions in the Cariaco Basin between March 2007 and November 2009 to measure the settling ﬂuxes of biogenic particles at 50 m (the base of the euphotic zone—Ez) and 100 m. Fluxes at these two depths were compared to concurrent ﬂuxes estimated with moored sediment traps at 150, 225 and 410 m from the CARIACO Ocean Time-Series program. We measured particulate organic carbon (POC), particulate organic nitrogen (PON), calcium carbonate, biogenic silica and terrigenous material concentrations in samples collected with both the drifting and moored traps. We also estimated the ﬂuxes of foraminifera shells and coccolithophore cells at 50 and 100 m using drifting traps samples. Surface chlorophyll a and primary production observations during each sampling period were examined to quantify the relationship between the magnitude and geochemical composition of the vertical ﬂux and overlying production. Surface chlorophyll a concentrations and primary production rates were highest during months of upwelling (2.58 À 1.35 mg mÀ3 and 3.6 À 1.4 g C mÀ2 dÀ1, respectively). The ﬂuxes of POC, PON, calcite and silica measured during the upwelling season (December–May) were typically higher than during the period of non-upwelling (August–November), when surface waters are more strongly stratiﬁed. POC ﬂuxes measured with the drifting traps (50 and 100 m) varied between 0.95 (upwelling) and 0.14 g mÀ2 dÀ1 (non-upwelling), compared with those from the moored traps (150, 225 and 410 m) which ranged from 0.21 to 0.01 g mÀ2 dÀ1. Similarly, the ﬂuxes of biogenic opal in the upper 100 m ranged from 1.12 and 0.18 g mÀ2 dÀ1, and those at greater depths varied from 0.27 g mÀ2 dÀ1 during upwelling to values near zero during stratiﬁcation periods. The ﬂuxes of POC, PON, calcite and silica in the upper 100 m decreased by an order of magnitude at the depth of the oxic–anoxic interface ( 4200 m). The sinking organic matter collected with the ﬂoating traps within the upper 100 m was signiﬁcantly correlated with surface chlorophyll a concentrations (r ¼ 0.68, p o0.05) as a result of close coupling between the ﬂux of biogenic particles and primary production. In contrast, there was no clear relationship between surface chlorophyll/primary production and ﬂuxes measured below 150 m depth.},

Chemical properties, biogeochemical cycles and food-webs have been altered with consequences for all marine living organisms. Knowledge on these pressures and associated responses mainly originate from analyses of a few long-term monitoring time series as well as spatially scattered data from various sources. Although the interpretation of these data can be improved by models, there is still a fundamental lack of information and knowledge if scientists are to predict more accurately the effects of human activities. Scientists provide expert advices to society about marine system governance, but such advices should rest on a solid base of observations. Nevertheless, many monitoring programs around the world are currently facing ﬁnancial reduction.

	abstract = {Background: The question of how many marine species exist is important because it provides a metric for how much we do and do not know about life in the oceans. We have compiled the ﬁrst register of the marine species of the world and used this baseline to estimate how many more species, partitioned among all major eukaryotic groups, may be discovered.
Results: There are w226,000 eukaryotic marine species described. More species were described in the past decade (w20,000) than in any previous one. The number of authors describing new species has been increasing at a faster rate than the number of new species described in the past six decades. We report that there are w170,000 synonyms, that 58,000–72,000 species are collected but not yet described, and that 482,000–741,000 more species have yet to be sampled. Molecular methods may add tens of thousands of cryptic species. Thus, there may be 0.7–1.0 million marine species. Past rates of description of new species indicate there may be 0.5 6 0.2 million marine species. On average 37\% (median 31\%) of species in over 100 recent ﬁeld studies around the world might be new to science.
Conclusions: Currently, between one-third and two-thirds of marine species may be undescribed, and previous estimates of there being well over one million marine species appear highly unlikely. More species than ever before are being described annually by an increasing number of authors. If the current trend continues, most species will be discovered this century.},

However, changing nutrient loading does have consequential impacts on the availability of other requirements including light and carbon dioxide. It is argued that the trophic spectrum is not a single dimension of a single factor but, rather, a template of factors covarying in consequence of the larger levels of biomass that are supported, and which weight in favour of the growth and survival prospects of particular kinds of planktonic algae.

The two fluxes are critically dependent on geophysical processes that determine mixed-layer depth, nutrient fluxes to and within the ocean, and food-web structure. Because the average turnover time of phytoplankton carbon in the ocean is on the order of a week or less, total and export production are extremely sensitive to external forcing and consequently are seldom in steady state. Elucidating the biogeochemical controls and feedbacks on primary production is essential to understanding how oceanic biota responded to and affected natural climatic variability in the geological past, and will respond to anthropogenically influenced changes in coming decades. One of the most crucial feedbacks results from changes in radiative forcing on the hydrological cycle, which influences the aeolian iron flux and, in turn, affects nitrogen fixation and primary production in the oceans.},

We use time series data on species abundance and environmental conditions in northeast Pacific systems to explore physicalbiological linkages underlying ecosystem structure and function, as well as the mechanisms driving stability and change over time. We classify species to diet-based functional guilds and explore the extent to which species within and between guilds exhibit common responses to environmental variables. We also distinguish distinct environmental thresholds for individual species, quantify how habitat variables influence the structuring of biological communities, and examine how trends in climate might influence shifts in community composition, range, and species dominance. Patterns suggest that habitat constraints and environmental thresholds influence guilds in distinct ways. Despite distinctions in physical and biological structure across systems, we note common trends in species dynamics within functional guilds, providing insight to common patterns and potential responses to climate change in these systems.},

However, there is a need to extend these methods to whole assemblages, to establish where along the range of these gradients the important compositional changes occur, and to identify any important thresholds or change points. We develop such a method, called ‘‘gradient forest,’’ which is an extension of the random forest approach. By synthesizing the cross-validated R2 and accuracy importance measures from univariate random forest analyses across multiple species, sampling devices, and surveys, gradient forest obtains a monotonic function of each predictor that represents the compositional turnover along the gradient of the predictor. When applied to a synthetic data set, the method correctly identiﬁed the important predictors and delineated where the compositional change points occurred along these gradients. Application of gradient forest to a real data set from part of the Great Barrier Reef identiﬁed mud fraction of the sediment as the most important predictor, with highest compositional turnover occurring at mud fraction values around 25\%, and provided similar information for other predictors. Such reﬁned information allows for more accurate capturing of biodiversity patterns for the purposes of bioregionalization, delineation of protected areas, or designing of biodiversity surveys.},

            The future response of marine ecosystem diversity to continued anthropogenic forcing is poorly constrained. Phytoplankton are a diverse set of organisms that form the base of the marine ecosystem. Currently, ocean biogeochemistry and ecosystem models used for climate change projections typically include only 2−3 phytoplankton types and are, therefore, too simple to adequately assess the potential for changes in plankton community structure. Here, we analyse a complex ecosystem model with 35 phytoplankton types to evaluate the changes in phytoplankton community composition, turnover and size structure over the 21st century. We find that the rate of turnover in the phytoplankton community becomes faster during this century, that is, the community structure becomes increasingly unstable in response to climate change. Combined with alterations to phytoplankton diversity, our results imply a loss of ecological resilience with likely knock-on effects on the productivity and functioning of the marine environment.},

Although there is emerging consensus that diversity enhances productivity and stability in communities of higher organisms; however, we still do not know whether these relationships apply also for communities of unicellular organisms, such as phytoplankton, which contribute ≈50\% to the global primary production. We show here that phytoplankton resource use, and thus carbon fixation, is directly linked to the diversity of phytoplankton communities. Datasets from freshwater and brackish habitats show that diversity is the best predictor for resource use efficiency of phytoplankton communities across considerable environmental gradients. Furthermore, we show that the diversity requirement for stable ecosystem functioning scales with the nutrient level (total phosphorus), as evidenced by the opposing effects of diversity (negative) and resource level (positive) on the variability of both resource use and community composition. Our analyses of large-scale observational data are consistent with experimental and model studies demonstrating causal effects of microbial diversity on functional properties at the system level. Our findings point at potential linkages between eutrophication and pollution-mediated loss of phytoplankton diversity. Factors reducing phytoplankton diversity may have direct detrimental effects on the amount and predictability of aquatic primary production.},

The protocol was modiﬁed from the literature to ﬁt the needs of the study, using correspondence analysis and k-means clustering. A novel index for ordination and selection of taxa based on frequency and evenness was developed. The Total Inertia analysis showed that this index better preserved the available information.

We obtained a rough picture of the seasonal separation of the diatom-dominated community from the mixed community and a reﬁned picture of the phenology of the assemblages and bloom events. The spring diatom peak proved to be inconstant and short-lived, while the autumn bloom was generally long and diverse. As expected for nearshore environments, the average life span of the assemblages was found to be short-periodic (2–4 months). The second part of the year and the last part of the series were more prone to changes in terms of typical assemblages.},

            Because microbial plankton in the ocean comprise diverse bacteria, algae, and protists that are subject to environmental forcing on multiple spatial and temporal scales, a fundamental open question is to what extent these organisms form ecologically cohesive communities. Here we show that although all taxa undergo large, near daily fluctuations in abundance, microbial plankton are organized into clearly defined communities whose turnover is rapid and sharp. We analyze a time series of 93 consecutive days of coastal plankton using a technique that allows inference of communities as modular units of interacting taxa by determining positive and negative correlations at different temporal frequencies. This approach shows both coordinated population expansions that demarcate community boundaries and high frequency of positive and negative associations among populations within communities. Our analysis thus highlights that the environmental variability of the coastal ocean is mirrored in sharp transitions of defined but ephemeral communities of organisms.},

	abstract = {Theory and observations suggest that low frequency variation in marine plankton populations, or red noise, may arise through cumulative integration of white noise atmospheric forcing by the ocean and its ampliﬁcation within food webs. Here, we revisit evidence for the integration of stochastic atmospheric variations by comparing the power spectra of time series of atmospheric and oceanographic conditions to the population dynamics of 150 plankton taxa at Station L4 in the Western English Channel. The power spectra of oceanographic conditions (sea surface temperature, surface nitrate) are redder than those of atmospheric forcing (surface wind stress, net heat ﬂuxes) at Station L4. However, plankton populations have power spectral slopes across trophic levels and body sizes that are redder than atmospheric forcing but whiter than oceanographic conditions. While zooplankton have redder spectral slopes than phytoplankton, there is no signiﬁcant relationship between power spectral slope and body size or generation length. Using a predator−prey model, we show that the whitening of plankton time series relative to oceanographic conditions arises from noisy plankton bloom dynamics in this strongly seasonal system. The model indicates that, for typical predator−prey interactions, where the predator is on average 10 times longer than the prey, grazing leads to a modest reddening of phytoplankton variability by their larger and longer lived zooplankton consumers. Our ﬁndings suggest that, beyond extrinsic forcing by the environment, predator–prey interactions play a role in inﬂuencing the power spectra of time series of plankton populations.},

	abstract = {How diverse are marine planktonic protist communities? How much seasonality do they exhibit? For a very long time, these two old and challenging questions in the field of plankton ecology could be addressed only for large‐size protist species, based on cell counting under the microscope. The recent application of molecular techniques, notably massive marker‐gene amplicon sequencing approaches (metabarcoding), has allowed investigating with unprecedented level of resolution the small‐sized ({\textless}20 µm) planktonic eukaryotes too. An amazing diversity of these tiny organisms has been unveiled but details about their temporal dynamics remain much more elusive. In a From the Cover article in this issue of Molecular Ecology, Giner et al. (2019) introduce a new Recurrence Index (RI) to specifically look for seasonality in time‐series metabarcoding data. They inspected the temporal dynamics of all operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in a rich sequence data set of pico‐ and nanoplanktonic eukaryotes in samples collected monthly during 10 years. Although most OTUs did not show seasonality, some abundant ones did, which explains why some averaging methods can find seasonality at the less detailed level of whole planktonic communities. Not surprisingly, the very complex small‐sized eukaryotic plankton communities are composed of organisms with miscellaneous temporal dynamics.},

	abstract = {Organic carbon ﬂuxes were measured in the anoxic water column of the Cariaco Basin under varying levels of primary productivity. Our results indicate that water column degradation of fresh organic matter in this anoxic setting is similar to what has been previously observed in the open ocean. Additionally, the rate at which carbon is consumed increases as primary productivity increases. These ﬁndings support the hypothesis that sulfate reduction is as efﬁcient as aerobic respiration in degrading labile organic matter and that an anoxic water column does not necessarily result in an enhanced delivery of organic carbon to the sea ﬂoor. We estimate that 1–2\% of the organic carbon produced at the surface reaches the seaﬂoor and that approximately 50\% of this is preserved in the sediments. This burial efﬁciency is comparable to that previously reported for both oxic and anoxic settings, and with sedimentation rates similar to that in Cariaco Basin.},

	title = {Changes in extreme temperature and precipitation in the {Caribbean} region, 1961–2010},
	abstract = {A workshop was held at the University of the West Indies, Jamaica, in May 2012 to build capacity in climate data rescue and to enhance knowledge about climate change in the Caribbean region. Scientists brought their daily observational surface temperature and precipitation data from weather stations for an assessment of quality and homogeneity and for the calculation of climate indices helpful for studying climate change in their region. This study presents the trends in daily and extreme temperature and precipitation indices in the Caribbean region for records spanning the 1961–2010 and 1986–2010 intervals. Overall, the results show a warming of the surface air temperature at land stations. In general, the indices based on minimum temperature show stronger warming trends than indices calculated from maximum temperature. The frequency of warm days, warm nights and extreme high temperatures has increased while fewer cool days, cool nights and extreme low temperatures were found for both periods. Changes in precipitation indices are less consistent and the trends are generally weak. Small positive trends were found in annual total precipitation, daily intensity, maximum number of consecutive dry days and heavy rainfall events particularly during the period 1986–2010. Correlations between indices and the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) index suggest that temperature variability and, to a lesser extent, precipitation extremes are related to the AMO signal of the North Atlantic surface sea temperatures: stronger associations are found in August and September for the temperature indices and in June and October for some of the precipitation indices.},

	abstract = {Multidecadal variability in the Atlantic Ocean and its importance to the Earth's climate system has been the subject of study in the physical oceanography ﬁeld for decades. Only recently, however, has the importance of this variability, termed the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation or AMO, been recognized by ecologists as an important factor inﬂuencing ecosystem state. A growing body of literature suggests that AMO-related ﬂuctuations are associated with shifts in ecological boundaries, primary productivity, and a number of ecologically and economically important coastal and marine populations across the Atlantic basin. Although the AMO is a basin-wide index of SST, the drivers of ecosystem change encompass more than temperature anomalies and the mode of action differs within each ecosystem. A common theme in assessing ecosystem change indicates that ﬂuctuations in water masses and circulation patterns drive shifts in ecosystem states, but the magnitude and rate of change is dependent on the physical characteristics of the region. Because of the wide ranging geographic effects of the AMO, and considering its multidecadal nature, a more complete understanding of its causes and effects would allow scientists and managers to more effectively inform ecosystem-based management across the Atlantic Basin.},

	abstract = {Caribbean basin tropical cyclone activity shows signiﬁcant variability on interannual as well as multidecadal time scales. Comprehensive statistics for Caribbean hurricane activity are tabulated, and then large-scale climate features are examined for their impacts on this activity. The primary interannual driver of variability is found to be El Nin˜ o–Southern Oscillation, which alters levels of activity due to changes in levels of vertical wind shear as well as through column stability. Much more activity occurs in the Caribbean with La Nin˜ a conditions than with El Nin˜ o conditions. On the multidecadal time scale, the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation is shown to play a signiﬁcant role in Caribbean hurricane activity, likely linked to its close relationship with multidecadal alterations in the size of the Atlantic warm pool and the phase of the Atlantic meridional mode. When El Nin˜ o–Southern Oscillation and the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation are examined in combination, even stronger relationships are found due to a combination of either favorable or unfavorable dynamic and thermodynamic factors. For example, 29 hurricanes tracked into the Caribbean in the 10 strongest La Nin˜ a years in a positive Atlantic multidecadal oscillation period compared with only two hurricanes tracking through the Caribbean in the 10 strongest El Nin˜ o years in a negative Atlantic multidecadal oscillation period.},

Ordination techniques including nonmetric multidimensional scaling, indicator species analysis, and BIO-ENV software were used to investigate potential environmental predictors of phytoplankton assemblage patterns under chronic eutrophication. Phytoplankton assemblages were strongly related to temperature and total nitrogen : total phosphorus ratios, with expected seasonal changes in species composition. Interannual changes in river discharge influenced whether phytoplankton assemblages were dominated by diatoms and phototrophic flagellates or by mixotrophic and heterotrophic dinoflagellates. Increasing ammonium concentrations also have been an important influence on phytoplankton assemblages. Raphidophytes (including the potentially toxic species Heterosigma akashiwo), haptophytes, chlorophytes, and the bloom-forming dinoflagellate Heterocapsa rotundata have increased in more recent years (2000–2006), concomitant with increasing ammonium concentrations. Abundance of the potentially toxic dinoflagellates Prorocentrum minimum and the grouping Pfiesteria spp., ‘‘pfiesteria-like’’ dinoflagellates, and Karlodinium veneficum remained stationary over time and rarely exceeded 103 cells mL21. Abundance of P. minimum was positively related to dissolved organic nitrogen and suspended solids concentrations, whereas the highest abundance of the grouping Pfiesteria spp., ‘‘pfiesteria-like’’ dinoflagellates, and K. veneficum occurred during summer and fall, related to high total phosphorus concentrations, temperature, and salinity. Overall, this study provides new species-level insights to advance understanding about anthropogenic influences on phytoplankton assemblages. The data suggest an increasingly important role of ammonium in controlling phytoplankton assemblage structure, including increased abundance of some harmful species, in eutrophic estuaries.},

Periods of warm (positive) and cold (negative) anomalies at the station were related to variability in coastal upwelling intensity. A positive temporal trend in monthlydeseasonalized sea surface temperatures (SST) was observed, leading to an overall increase of 1.13 1C over 13 years. Surface fCO2sea displayed signiﬁcant short-term variation (month to month) with a range of 330–445 matm. In addition to a large seasonal range (58 7 17 matm), deseasonalized fCO2sea data showed an interannual positive trend of 1.77 7 0.43 matm yrÀ1. In the Cariaco Basin, positive and negative anomalies of temperature and fCO2sea are in phase. An increase/decrease of 1 1C coincides with an increase/decrease of 16–20 matm of fCO2sea. Deseasonalized fCO2sea normalized to 26.05 1C, the mean Cariaco SST, shows a lower rate of increase (0.51 7 0.49 matm yrÀ1). Based on these observations, 72\% of the increase in fCO2sea in Cariaco Basin between 1996 and 2008 can be attributed to an increasing temperature trend of surface waters, making this the primary factor controlling fugacity at this location. During this period, a decrease in upwelling intensity was also observed. The phytoplankton community changed from large diatom-dominated blooms during upwelling in the late 1990’s to blooms dominated by smaller cells in the ﬁrst decade of the 21st century. The average net sea-air CO2 ﬂux over the study period is 2.0 7 2.6 mol C mÀ2 yrÀ1 employing the Wanninkhof parameterization, and 2.1 72.5 mol C mÀ2 yrÀ1 based on Nightingale’s model. To further understand the connection between the changes observed in the Cariaco Basin, the relationships between interannual variability in the temperature anomaly with three modes of climate variability (AMO, NAO and ENSO) were examined. The correlations between SSTA and two of these climate modes (AMO and ENSO) only show very weak relationships, although they were signiﬁcant.},

              The fossil record of marine invertebrates has long fuelled the debate as to whether or not there are limits to global diversity in the sea

              . Here we present a regional diversification model that reproduces the main Phanerozoic eon trends in the global diversity of marine invertebrates after imposing mass extinctions. We find that the dynamics of global diversity are best described by a diversification model that operates widely within the exponential growth regime of a logistic function. A spatially resolved analysis of the ratio of diversity to carrying capacity reveals that less than 2\% of the global flooded continental area throughout the Phanerozoic exhibits diversity levels approaching ecological saturation. We attribute the overall increase in global diversity during the Late Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras to the development of diversity hotspots under prolonged conditions of Earth system stability and maximum continental fragmentation. We call this the ‘diversity hotspots hypothesis’, which we propose as a non-mutually exclusive alternative to the hypothesis that the Mesozoic marine revolution led this macroevolutionary trend

              Marine phytoplankton generate half of global primary production, making them essential to ecosystem functioning and biogeochemical cycling. Though phytoplankton are phylogenetically diverse, studies rarely designate unique thermal traits to different taxa, resulting in coarse representations of phytoplankton thermal responses. Here we assessed phytoplankton functional responses to temperature using empirically derived thermal growth rates from four principal contributors to marine productivity: diatoms, dinoflagellates, cyanobacteria, and coccolithophores. Using modeled sea surface temperatures for 1950–1970 and 2080–2100, we explored potential alterations to each group’s growth rates and geographical distribution under a future climate change scenario. Contrary to the commonly applied Eppley formulation, our data suggest phytoplankton functional types may be characterized by different temperature coefficients (Q
              10
              ), growth maxima thermal dependencies, and thermal ranges which would drive dissimilar responses to each degree of temperature change. These differences, when applied in response to global simulations of future temperature, result in taxon-specific projections of growth and geographic distribution, with low-latitude coccolithophores facing considerable decreases and cyanobacteria substantial increases in growth rates. These results suggest that the singular effect of changing temperature may alter phytoplankton global community structure, owing to the significant variability in thermal response between phytoplankton functional types.},

                  Global concern about human impact on biological diversity has triggered an intense research agenda on drivers and consequences of biodiversity change in parallel with international policy seeking to conserve biodiversity and associated ecosystem functions. Quantifying the trends in biodiversity is far from trivial, however, as recently documented by meta‐analyses, which report little if any net change in local species richness through time.
                
                
                  Here, we summarise several limitations of species richness as a metric of biodiversity change and show that the expectation of directional species richness trends under changing conditions is invalid. Instead, we illustrate how a set of species turnover indices provide more information content regarding temporal trends in biodiversity, as they reflect how dominance and identity shift in communities over time.
                
                
                  We apply these metrics to three monitoring datasets representing different ecosystem types. In all datasets, nearly complete species turnover occurred, but this was disconnected from any species richness trends. Instead, turnover was strongly influenced by changes in species presence (identities) and dominance (abundances). We further show that these metrics can detect phases of strong compositional shifts in monitoring data and thus identify a different aspect of biodiversity change decoupled from species richness.
                
                
                  
                    Synthesis and applications
                    : Temporal trends in species richness are insufficient to capture key changes in biodiversity in changing environments. In fact, reductions in environmental quality can lead to transient increases in species richness if immigration or extinction has different temporal dynamics. Thus, biodiversity monitoring programmes need to go beyond analyses of trends in richness in favour of more meaningful assessments of biodiversity change.

We quantified patterns of temporal α diversity, measured as change in local diversity, and temporal β diversity, measured as change in community composition. Contrary to our expectations, we did not detect systematic loss of α diversity. However, community composition changed systematically through time, in excess of predictions from null models. Heterogeneous rates of environmental change, species range shifts associated with climate change, and biotic homogenization may explain the different patterns of temporal α and β diversity.

Resource availability was measured as total nitrogen and phosphorus. Resource imbalance was determined as (1) the ratio of dissolved inorganic nitrogen to total phosphorus and (2) an experimentally veriﬁed indicator quantiﬁed by modelling responses in 14C-based primary production to nutrient additions. Resource availability explained variance in biomass, productivity, and species richness, as expected by the Species Energy Theory, but not evenness. Linear mixed-effects models conﬁrmed the overall relation between productivity and resource availability, whereas other resource availability relations showed also notable clustering by region. The Resource Ratio Theory predicting that diversity increases with the number of limiting resources was not supported. Nutrient imbalance had a weak effect on the biomass of N2-ﬁxing cyanobacteria, but not their share of total phytoplankton biomass. Contrary to many previous studies on biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships, we found a highly signiﬁcant inverse relationship between evenness and biomass. This indicates that species-rich natural phytoplankton communities form the basis for opportunistic species to temporarily monopolize resources and create blooms. The result was consistent across regions, although their community composition differed. Metacommunity dynamics were important, since distance between the regions explained higher percentage of the variability than local resources together. As the species able to monopolize resources vary widely in their role for aquatic food webs and environmental consequences (e.g., food quality, toxicity), species-level trait data is essential to understand better diversity-productivity relationships.},

The atmospheric patterns, associated with the positive phase of the AMO, include anomalous low pressure over the Atlantic between 20°S and 50°N, cyclonic surface winds around the low, reduced wind speeds over the tropical Atlantic and enhanced precipitation in the eastern tropical Atlantic, with roughly opposite conditions during negative AMO phases. There are, however, substantial differences in the SST and the atmospheric anomalies between periods of the same phase, especially in the extratropics. Correlations between the AMO and air temperature anomalies are positive over much of the globe between 40°S and 50°N, with correlations exceeding 0.6 ({\textasciitilde}95\% signiﬁcance level) over the Maritime Continent and northern rim of the Paciﬁc Ocean. Most of the sea level pressure (SLP) anomalies beyond the Atlantic are not statistically signiﬁcant.},

	abstract = {Understanding the relationship between diversity and stability requires a knowledge of how species interact with each other and how each is affected by the environment. The relationship is also complex, because the concept of stability is multifaceted; different types of stability describing different properties of ecosystems lead to multiple diversity-stability relationships. A growing number of empirical studies demonstrate positive diversity-stability relationships. These studies, however, have emphasized only a few types of stability, and they rarely uncover the mechanisms responsible for stability. Because anthropogenic changes often affect stability and diversity simultaneously, diversity-stability relationships cannot be understood outside the context of the environmental drivers affecting both. This shifts attention away from diversity-stability relationships toward the multiple factors, including diversity, that dictate the stability of ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Species composition plays a key role in ecosystem functioning. Theoretical, experimental and ﬁeld studies show positive effects of biodiversity on ecosystem processes. However, this link can differ between taxonomic and functional diversity components and also across trophic levels. These relationships have been hardly studied in planktonic communities of coastal upwelling systems. Using a 28-year time series of phytoplankton and zooplankton assemblages, we examined the effects of phytoplankton diversity on resource use efﬁciency (RUE, ratio of biomass to limiting resource) at the two trophic levels in the Galician upwelling system (NW Iberian peninsula). By ﬁtting generalized least square models, we show that phytoplankton diversity was the best predictor for RUE across planktonic trophic levels. This link varied depending on the biodiversity component considered: while the effect of phytoplankton richness on RUE was positive for phytoplankton RUE and negative for zooplankton RUE, phytoplankton evenness effect was negative for phytoplankton RUE and positive for zooplankton RUE. Overall, taxonomic diversity had higher explanatory power than functional diversity, and variability in phytoplankton and zooplankton RUE decreased with increasing phytoplankton taxonomic diversity. Phytoplankton used resources more efﬁciently in warmer waters and at greater upwelling intensity, although these effects were not as strong as those for biodiversity. These results suggest that phytoplankton species numbers in highly dynamic upwelling systems are important for maintaining the planktonic biomass production leading us to hypothesize the relevance of complementarity effects. However, we further postulate that a selection effect may operate also because assemblages with low evenness were dominated by diatoms with speciﬁc functional traits increasing their ability to exploit resources more efﬁciently.},

	abstract = {The oceans are changing more rapidly than ever before. Unprecedented climatic variability is interacting with unmistakable long-term trends, all against a backdrop of intensifying human activities. What remains unclear, however, is how to evaluate whether conditions have changed sufﬁciently to provoke major responses of species, habitats, and communities. We developed a framework based on multimodel inference to deﬁne ecosystem-based thresholds for human and environmental pressures in the California Current marine ecosystem. To demonstrate how to apply the framework, we explored two decades of data using gradient forest and generalized additive model analyses, screening for nonlinearities and potential threshold responses of ecosystem states (n = 9) across environmental (n = 6) and human (n = 10) pressures. These analyses identiﬁed the existence of threshold responses of ﬁve ecosystem states to four environmental and two human pressures. Both methods agreed on threshold relationships in two cases: (1) the winter copepod anomaly and habitat modiﬁcation, and (2) sea lion pup production and the summer mode of the Paciﬁc Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Considered collectively, however, these alternative analytical approaches imply that as many as ﬁve of the nine ecosystem states may exhibit threshold changes in response to negative PDO values in the summer (copepods, scavengers, groundﬁsh, and marine mammals). This result is consistent with the idea that the inﬂuence of the PDO extends across multiple trophic levels, but extends current knowledge by deﬁning the nonlinear nature of these responses. This research provides a new way to interpret changes in the intensities of human and environmental pressures as they relate to the ecological integrity of the California Current ecosystem. These insights can be used to make more informed assessments of when and under what conditions intervention, preparation, and mitigation may enhance progress toward ecosystem-based management goals.},

Physical structure and drivers combine with biological responses and interactions to organize marine systems in unique ways at multiple scales. We apply multivariate statistical methods to deﬁne spatially coherent ecological units or ecoregions in the eastern Bering Sea. We also illustrate a practical approach to integrate data on species distribution, habitat structure and physical forcing mechanisms to distinguish areas with distinct biogeography as one means to deﬁne management units in large marine ecosystems. We use random forests to quantify the relative importance of habitat and environmental variables to the distribution of individual species, and to quantify shifts in multispecies assemblages or community composition along environmental gradients. Threshold shifts in community composition are used to identify regions with distinct physical and biological attributes, and to evaluate the relative importance of predictor variables to determining regional boundaries. Depth, bottom temperature and frontal boundaries were dominant factors delineating distinct biological communities in this system, with a latitudinal divide at approximately 601N. Our results indicate that distinct climatic periods will shift habitat gradients and that dynamic physical variables such as temperature and stratiﬁcation are important to understanding temporal stability of ecoregion boundaries. We note distinct distribution patterns among functional guilds and also evidence for resource partitioning among individual species within each guild. By integrating physical and biological data to determine spatial patterns in community composition, we partition ecosystems along ecologically signiﬁcant gradients. This may provide a basis for deﬁning spatial management units or serve as a baseline index for analyses of structural shifts in the physical environment, species abundance and distribution, and community dynamics over time.},

	abstract = {Understanding environmental driver-response relationships is critical to the implementation of effective ecosystembased management. Ecosystems are often inﬂuenced by multiple drivers that operate on different timescales and may be nonstationary. In turn, contrasting views of ecosystem state and structure could arise depending on the temporal perspective of analysis. Further, assessment of multiple ecosystem components (e.g., biological indicators) may serve to identify different key drivers and connections. To explore how the timescale of analysis and data richness can inﬂuence the identiﬁcation of driver-response relationships within a large, dynamic ecosystem, this study analyzed long-term (1969–2018) data from Lake Erie (USA–Canada). Data were compiled on multiple biological, physical, chemical, and socioeconomic components of the ecosystem to quantify trends and identify potential key drivers during multiple time intervals (20 to 50 years duration), using zooplankton, bird, and ﬁsh community metrics as indicators of ecosystem change. Concurrent temporal shifts of many variables occurred during the 1980s, but asynchronous dynamics were evident among indicator taxa. The strengths and rank orders of predictive drivers shifted among intervals and were sometimes taxon-speciﬁc. Drivers related to nutrient loading and lake trophic status were consistently strong predictors of temporal patterns for all indicators; however, within the longer intervals, measures of agricultural land use were the strongest predictors, whereas within shorter intervals, the stronger predictors were measures of tributary or in-lake nutrient concentrations. Physical drivers also tended to increase in predictive ability within shorter intervals. The results highlight how the time interval examined can ﬁlter inﬂuences of lower-frequency, slower drivers and higher-frequency, faster drivers. Understanding ecosystem change in support of ecosystem-based management requires consideration of both the temporal perspective of analysis and the chosen indicators, as both can inﬂuence which drivers are identiﬁed as most predictive of ecosystem trends at that timescale.},

The shape of the diversity–functioning relationship varies along with variations in environmental drivers, which is of highest importance for ongoing discussions about impacts of global change on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.},

	abstract = {This paper analyses the life strategies, the dominance patterns and the diversity in phytoplankton communities in large and deep lakes. The study was carried out on the largest Italian Lake (Lake Garda) from 1995 to 2000. Different statistical analyses were applied. For phytoplankton the time variable represents a complex environmental gradient driving annual succession; this gradient was made explicit by the application of PCA analyses to the environmental data. The use of Non Metric Multi Dimensional Scaling applied to Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrices revealed an ordered and cyclic development of phytoplankton every year; the Bray-Curtis index, calculated between pairs of chronologically contiguous samples, was also used as a measure of the community change rate (βt) over the temporal succession. A signiﬁcant relationship between βt and the complex environmental gradient was assessed. Finally, for every phytoplankton species, the optimum conditions for growth and the realised niches were determined. The positioning of the species on the complex environmental gradient, and the contemporaneous application of cluster analysis based on the different speciﬁc environmental optima, highlighted primarily the existence of two groups at the extreme of the complex environmental gradient. The ﬁrst group included the large late winter/spring diatoms, which developed during high water turbulence and strong physical control, high nutrient concentrations, low light conditions and reduced competition. The second group was composed by many heterogeneous summer species characterised by the ability to contrast losses by grazing and sinking in stratiﬁed and stable conditions, and the ability of tolerating nutrient deﬁciency. A third group of species developed during environmental conditions in the middle of the two previous extremes. These included the three master species Mougeotia sp., Fragilaria crotonensis and Planktothrix rubescens/agardhii. The endogenous and exogenous mechanisms promoting species coexistence are discussed, along with the applicability of competitive and equilibrium/non-equilibrium theories to phytoplankton dynamics.},

Increased demand for living marine resources has resulted in global declines of targeted species, which are often managed under a single-species paradigm that does not fully incorporate ecosystem considerations such as ecological interactions or environmental factors. Ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) is a more holistic approach that concurrently addresses human, ecological, and environmental factors influencing living marine resources and evaluates these considerations collectively on a system level. For EBFM, reference points associated with management action need to be quantified. Methods have been developed to assign decision criteria to ecological indicators’ response to human-use pressures, yet few efforts have established decision criteria in response to the combined influence of humanuse and environmental pressures. We translated ecological indicator response into a surface dependent on both fishing and environmental pressures. Using generalized additive models, we empirically determined critical points at which a small change in fishing and environmental pressure results in an abrupt change in ecosystem status. For the Northeast United States Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem, we identified critical points in ecological indicators that represent system production, size distribution, community structure, and ecosystem functioning. Our findings highlight the need to include both anthropogenic and environmental pressures for delineation of ecosystem decision criteria.},

	abstract = {The Landsat program has long supported pioneering research on the recovery of forest information by remote sensing technologies for several decades, and eﬀorts to improve the thematic resolution and accuracy of forest compositional products remains an area of continued innovation. Recent development and application of Landsat time series analysis oﬀers unique opportunities for quantifying seasonality and trend components among diﬀerent forest types for developing alternative feature sets for forest vegetation mapping. Within a large forested landscape in Southeastern Ohio, USA, we examined the use of harmonic metrics developed from time series of all available Landsat-8 observations (2013–2019) relative to seasonal image composites, including accompanying spectral components and vegetation indices. A reference dataset among three sources was integrated and used to categorize forest inventory data into seven forest type classes and gradient compositional response. Results showed that the combination of harmonic metrics and topographic variables achieved an accuracy agreement with the reference data of 74.9\% relative to seasonal composites (71.6\%) and spectral indices (70.3\%). Diﬀerences in agreement were attributed to improved discrimination of three heterogeneous upland hardwood classes and an early-successional, young forest class, all forest types of primary interest among managers across the region. Variable importance metrics often identiﬁed the cosine and sine terms that quantify the seasonality in spectral values in the harmonic feature space, suggesting these aspects best support the characterization of forest types at greater thematic detail than seasonal compositing procedures. This study demonstrates how advanced time series metrics can improve forest type modeling and forest gradient quantiﬁcations, thus showcasing a need for continued exploration of such approaches across diﬀerent forest types.},

Quantifying the importance of environmental variables in explaining the species distribution can help build resilient populations in restoration projects and design forest management strategies. Using landscape genomics, we investigated the population structure and ecological adaptation of this tree species across the Mediterranean Basin. We applied genotyping by sequencing and derived 2,583 single nucleotide polymorphism markers genotyped from 81 individuals across 17 sites in the studied region. We implemented an approach based on the nearest neighbour haplotype ‘coancestry’ and uncovered a weak population structure along an east–­west climatic gradient across the Mediterranean region. We identified genomic regions potentially involved in local adaptation and predicted differences in the genetic composition across the landscape under current and future climates. Variants associated with temperature and precipitation variables were detected, and we applied a nonlinear multivariate association method, gradient forest, to project these gene–­environment relationships across space. The model allowed the identification of geographic areas within the western Mediterranean region most sensitive to climate change: south-­western Iberia and northern Morocco. Our findings provide a preliminary assessment towards a potential management strategy for the conservation of cork oak in the Mediterranean Basin.},

	abstract = {Temporal environmental fluctuations, such as seasonality, exert strong controls on biodiversity. While the effects of seasonality are well known, the predictability of fluctuations across years may influence seasonality in ways that are less well understood. The ability of a habitat to support unique, non-n­ ested assemblages of species at different times of the year should depend on both seasonality (occurrence of events at specific periods of the year) and predictability (the reliability of event recurrence) of characteristic ecological conditions. Drawing on tools from wavelet analysis and information theory, we developed a framework for quantifying both seasonality and predictability of habitats, and applied this using global long-­term rainfall data. Our analysis predicted that temporal beta diversity should be maximized in highly predictable and highly seasonal climates, and that low degrees of seasonality, predictability, or both would lower diversity in characteristic ways. Using stream invertebrate communities as a case study, we demonstrated that temporal species diversity, as exhibited by community turnover, was determined by a balance between temporal environmental variability (seasonality) and the reliability of this variability (predictability). Communities in highly seasonal mediterranean environments exhibited strong oscillations in community structure, with turnover from one unique community type to another across seasons, whereas communities in aseasonal New Zealand environments fluctuated randomly. Understanding the influence of seasonal and other temporal scales of environmental oscillations on diversity is not complete without a clear understanding of their predictability, and our framework provides tools for examining these trends at a variety of temporal scales, seasonal and beyond. Given the uncertainty of future climates, seasonality and predictability are critical considerations for both basic science and management of ecosystems (e.g., dam operations, bioassessment) spanning gradients of climatic variability.},

              1.
               Environmental variables are often used as indirect surrogates for mapping biodiversity because species survey data are scant at regional scales, especially in the marine realm. However, environmental variables are measured on arbitrary scales unlikely to have simple, direct relationships with biological patterns. Instead, biodiversity may respond nonlinearly and to interactions between environmental variables.
            
            
              2.
               To investigate the role of the environment in driving patterns of biodiversity composition in large marine regions, we collated multiple biological survey and environmental data sets from tropical NE Australia, the deep Gulf of Mexico and the temperate Gulf of Maine. We then quantified the shape and magnitude of multispecies responses along {\textgreater}30 environmental gradients and the extent to which these variables predicted regional distributions. To do this, we applied a new statistical approach,
              Gradient Forest
              , an extension of Random Forest, capable of modelling nonlinear and threshold responses.
            
            
              3.
               The regional‐scale environmental variables predicted an average of 13–35\% (up to 50–85\% for individual species) of the variation in species abundance distributions. Important predictors differed among regions and biota and included depth, salinity, temperature, sediment composition and current stress. The shapes of responses along gradients also differed and were nonlinear, often with thresholds indicative of step changes in composition. These differing regional responses were partly due to differing environmental indicators of bioregional boundaries and, given the results to date, may indicate limited scope for extrapolating bio‐physical relationships beyond the region of source data sets.

              Synthesis and applications
              . Gradient Forest offers a new capability for exploring relationships between biodiversity and environmental gradients, generating new information on multispecies responses at a detail not available previously. Importantly, given the scarcity of data, Gradient Forest enables the combined use of information from disparate data sets. The gradient response curves provide biologically informed transformations of environmental layers to predict and map expected patterns of biodiversity composition that represent sampled composition better than uninformed variables. The approach can be applied to support marine spatial planning and management and has similar applicability in terrestrial realms.

            Community dynamics are central in microbial ecology, yet we lack studies comparing diversity patterns among marine protists and prokaryotes over depth and multiple years. Here, we characterized microbes at the San-Pedro Ocean Time series (2005–2018), using SSU rRNA gene sequencing from two size fractions (0.2–1 and 1–80 μm), with a universal primer set that amplifies from both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, allowing direct comparisons of diversity patterns in a single set of analyses. The 16S + 18S rRNA gene composition in the small size fraction was mostly prokaryotic (\&gt;92\%) as expected, but the large size fraction unexpectedly contained 46–93\% prokaryotic 16S rRNA genes. Prokaryotes and protists showed opposite vertical diversity patterns; prokaryotic diversity peaked at mid-depth, protistan diversity at the surface. Temporal beta-diversity patterns indicated prokaryote communities were much more stable than protists. Although the prokaryotic communities changed monthly, the average community stayed remarkably steady over 14 years, showing high resilience. Additionally, particle-associated prokaryotes were more diverse than smaller free-living ones, especially at deeper depths, contributed unexpectedly by abundant and diverse SAR11 clade II. Eukaryotic diversity was strongly correlated with the diversity of particle-associated prokaryotes but not free-living ones, reflecting that physical associations result in the strongest interactions, including symbioses, parasitism, and decomposer relationships.},

We present some of the features of ecodist, particularly simple and partial Mantel tests, and make recommendations for their eﬀective use. Although the partial Mantel test is often used to account for the eﬀects of space, the assumption of linearity greatly reduces its eﬀectiveness for complex spatial patterns. We introduce a modiﬁcation of the Mantel correlogram designed to overcome this restriction and allow consideration of complex nonlinear structures. This extension of the method allows the use of partial multivariate correlograms and tests of relationship between variables at diﬀerent spatial scales. Some of the possibilities are demonstrated using both artiﬁcial data and data from an ongoing study of plant community composition in grazinglands of the northeastern United States.},

Across the integrated and harmonized dataset, we used multiple biodiversity descriptors to analyse temporal trends in the Wadden Sea phytoplankton. Biodiversity, measured as the number of species (S) and the effective number of species (ENS), has decreased in the Dutch stations over the last 20 years, while biomass has increased, indicating that fewer species are becoming more dominant in the system. However, biodiversity and biomass did not show substantial changes in the German stations. Although there were some differences in trends between countries, shifts in community composition and relative abundance were consistent across stations and time. We emphasise the importance of continuous and harmonized monitoring programmes and multi-metric approaches that can detect changes in the communities that are indicative of changes in the environment.},

              Deep-sea benthic foraminifera preserve an essential record of Earth's past climate in their oxygen- and carbon-isotope compositions. However, this record lacks sufficient temporal resolution and/or age control in some places to determine which climate forcing and feedback mechanisms were most important. Westerhold
              et al.
              present a highly resolved and well-dated record of benthic carbon and oxygen isotopes for the past 66 million years. Their reconstruction and analysis show that Earth's climate can be grouped into discrete states separated by transitions related to changing greenhouse gas levels and the growth of polar ice sheets. Each climate state is paced by orbital cycles but responds to variations in radiative forcing in a state-dependent manner.

            Much of our understanding of Earth’s past climate comes from the measurement of oxygen and carbon isotope variations in deep-sea benthic foraminifera. Yet, long intervals in existing records lack the temporal resolution and age control needed to thoroughly categorize climate states of the Cenozoic era and to study their dynamics. Here, we present a new, highly resolved, astronomically dated, continuous composite of benthic foraminifer isotope records developed in our laboratories. Four climate states—Hothouse, Warmhouse, Coolhouse, Icehouse—are identified on the basis of their distinctive response to astronomical forcing depending on greenhouse gas concentrations and polar ice sheet volume. Statistical analysis of the nonlinear behavior encoded in our record reveals the key role that polar ice volume plays in the predictability of Cenozoic climate dynamics.},

These include approaches such as phase space-based recurrence plots and recurrence networks, visibility graphs, order pattern-based entropies, and stochastic modelling. Here, we review and compare in detail several prominent methods from these ﬁelds by applying them to the same set of marine palaeoclimate proxy records of African climate variations during the past 5 million years. Applying these methods, we observe notable nonlinear transitions in palaeoclimate dynamics in these marine proxy records and discuss them in the context of important climate events and regimes such as phases of intensiﬁed Walker circulation, marine isotope stage M2, the onset of northern hemisphere glaciation and the mid-Pleistocene transition. We ﬁnd that the studied approaches complement each other by allowing us to point out distinct aspects of dynamical regime shifts in palaeoclimate time series. We also detect signiﬁcant correlations of these nonlinear regime shift indicators with variations of Earth's orbit, suggesting the latter as potential triggers of nonlinear transitions in palaeoclimate. Overall, the presented study underlines the potentials of nonlinear time series analysis approaches to provide complementary information on dynamical regime shifts in palaeoclimate and their driving processes that cannot be revealed by linear statistics or eyeball inspection of the data alone.},

	abstract = {Recurrence is a fundamental property of dynamical systems, which can be exploited to characterise the system’s behaviour in phase space. A powerful tool for their visualisation and analysis called recurrence plot was introduced in the late 1980’s. This report is a comprehensive overview covering recurrence based methods and their applications with an emphasis on recent developments. After a brief outline of the theory of recurrences, the basic idea of the recurrence plot with its variations is presented. This includes the quantiﬁcation of recurrence plots, like the recurrence quantiﬁcation analysis, which is highly effective to detect, e. g., transitions in the dynamics of systems from time series. A main point is how to link recurrences to dynamical invariants and unstable periodic orbits. This and further evidence suggest that recurrences contain all relevant information about a system’s behaviour. As the respective phase spaces of two systems change due to coupling, recurrence plots allow studying and quantifying their interaction. This fact also provides us with a sensitive tool for the study of synchronisation of complex systems. In the last part of the report several applications of recurrence plots in economy, physiology, neuroscience, earth sciences, astrophysics and engineering are shown. The aim of this work is to provide the readers with the know how for the application of recurrence plot based methods in their own ﬁeld of research. We therefore detail the analysis of data and indicate possible difﬁculties and pitfalls.},

	abstract = {Complex systems can, to a ﬁrst approximation, be characterized by the fact that their dynamics emerging at the macroscopic level cannot be easily explained from the microscopic dynamics of the individual constituents of the system. This property of complex systems can be identiﬁed in virtually all natural systems surrounding us, but also in many social, economic, and technological systems. The deﬁning characteristics of complex systems imply that their dynamics can often only be captured from the analysis of simulated or observed data. Here, we summarize recent advances in nonlinear data analysis of both simulated and real-world complex systems, with a focus on recurrence analysis for the investigation of individual or small sets of time series, and complex networks for the analysis of possibly very large, spatiotemporal datasets. We review and explain the recent success of these two key concepts of complexity science with an emphasis on applications for the analysis of geoscientiﬁc and in particular (palaeo-) climate data. In particular, we present several prominent examples where challenging problems in Earth system and climate science have been successfully addressed using recurrence analysis and complex networks. We outline several open questions for future lines of research in the direction of data-based complex system analysis, again with a focus on applications in the Earth sciences, and suggest possible combinations with suitable machine learning approaches. Beyond Earth system analysis, these methods have proven valuable also in many other scientiﬁc disciplines, such as neuroscience, physiology, epidemics, or engineering.},

	abstract = {How much temporal recurrence is present in microbial assemblages is still an unanswered ecological question. Even though marked seasonal changes have been reported for whole microbial communities, less is known on the dynamics and seasonality of individual taxa. Here, we aim at understanding microbial recurrence at three different levels: community, taxonomic group and operational taxonomic units (OTUs). For that, we focused on a model microbial eukaryotic community populating a long‐term marine microbial observatory using 18S rRNA gene data from two organismal size fractions: the picoplankton (0.2–3 µm) and the nanoplankton (3–20 µm). We have developed an index to quantify recurrence in particular taxa. We found that community structure oscillated systematically between two main configurations corresponding to winter and summer over the 10 years studied. A few taxonomic groups such as Mamiellophyceae or MALV‐III presented clear recurrence (i.e., seasonality), whereas 13\%–19\% of the OTUs in both size fractions, accounting for {\textasciitilde}40\% of the relative abundance, featured recurrent dynamics. Altogether, our work links longterm whole community dynamics with that of individual OTUs and taxonomic groups, indicating that recurrent and non‐recurrent changes characterize the dynamics of microbial assemblages.},

	abstract = {Background: Despite enormous environmental variability linked to glacial/interglacial climates of the Pleistocene, we have recently shown that marine diatom communities evolved slowly through gradual changes over the past 1.5 million years. Identifying the causes of this ecological stability is key for understanding the mechanisms that control the tempo and mode of community evolution.
Methodology/Principal Findings: If community assembly were controlled by local environmental selection rather than dispersal, environmental perturbations would change community composition, yet, this could revert once environmental conditions returned to previous-like states. We analyzed phytoplankton community composition across .104 km latitudinal transects in the Atlantic Ocean and show that local environmental selection of broadly dispersed species primarily controls community structure. Consistent with these results, three independent fossil records of marine diatoms over the past 250,000 years show cycles of community departure and recovery tightly synchronized with the temporal variations in Earth’s climate.
Conclusions/Significance: Changes in habitat conditions dramatically alter community structure, yet, we conclude that the high dispersal of marine planktonic microbes erases the legacy of past environmental conditions, thereby decreasing the tempo of community evolution.},

	abstract = {The water quality of the Middle Route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project (MRP) of China is related to the health and safety of about 8500w people. In recent years, multiple occurrences of abnormal algal prolifer­ ation in water conveyance channels have posed potential risks to the water quality of diverted water. To clarify the growth situation of phytoplankton and evaluate the response relationships between water environmental parameters and phytoplankton in the MRP, in this study, a long-term monitoring dataset was collected from seven monitoring sites from May 2015 to December 2020 to statistically analyse the spatiotemporal character­ istics of planktonic algal cell density (ACD). Based on this, four machine learning models, including multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector regression (SVR), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XBGoost), were constructed to predict the ACD, and the SHapely Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was used to interpret the best prediction model for identifying the response relationship between water environ­ mental parameters and ACD. The results showed that (1) the seven monitoring sites could be divided into two significant groups (i.e., Group I and Group II) by hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA), among which the ACD of Group II was higher than that of Group I. (2) the performance of four prediction models using different evalu­ ation metrics indicated that the RF model surpassed in prediction accuracy compared with the other three models in predicting ACD variations in Group I and Group II. (3) SHAP analysis revealed that the key factors affecting ACD variations in Group I were water temperature (WT), water depth (WD), permanganate index (PI), flow rate (Q) and dissolved oxygen (DO), and the ACD were inhibited when WT was below 23 ◦C, WD exceeded 6.5 m, and Q was between 100 and 250 m3/s. Additionally, WT, PI, and DO were the most important predictors of ACD in Group II, and ACD were inhibited when WT was below 24 ◦C, PI was lower than 2.4 mg/L and DO was higher than 9 mg/L. This research provides a theoretical basis and reference for water quality management and algal ecological control of water transfer projects with high spatial heterogeneity.},

	abstract = {The spectral absorption coefﬁcient of marine phytoplankton provides information on phytoplankton community structure, biomass, and general physiological conditions. These variables are necessary for understanding and predicting ocean productivity, carbon ﬂuxes, underwater light propagation, water quality, and for assessing marine photochemical processes. The Cariaco Basin, located on the continental shelf of Venezuela in the southeastern Caribbean Sea, is the site of the CARIACO Ocean Time-Series project. Since 1995, CARIACO has collected bio-optical (hyperspectral inherent and apparent optical properties — IOPs and AOPs, respectively), biogeochemical and ecological observations to characterize local ecosystem variations in response to regional and global changes in climate. We examine phytoplankton taxonomic and pigment time series data collected by this program between 2006 and 2012 to understand how seasonal changes in these parameters relate to biooptical data (i.e., absorption spectra). TChla and accessory pigments varied seasonally in response to changes in the phytoplankton community composition, with higher concentrations of microphytoplankton (N 20 μm; 45\%) during upwelling (December–April) than during the rainy season (16\%; May/June–October/November). Picophytoplankton (b 2 μm) dominated during the rainy season (66\%). The absorption properties also exhibited seasonal variations. Diagnostic pigments could not be identiﬁed in a quantitative way using derivative analysis of phytoplankton absorption, likely because of overlapping of absorption spectra among the pigments present. The POC:TChla ratio at CARIACO was variable and dependent on bulk carbon (not necessarily related to phytoplankton) and the functional groups present at any given time, underscoring the fact that using a ﬁxed ratio of POC:Chla in biogeochemical models can lead to large uncertainties in carbon budgets from coastal zones. Low POC:TChla was associated with microphytoplankton size class (diatoms), while picophytoplankton (cyanobacteria) exhibited higher ratios. These results contribute to furthering our understanding of coastal phytoplankton dynamics and how they relate to optical signatures.},

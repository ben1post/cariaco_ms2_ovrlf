	abstract = {In 2010, the international community, under the auspices of the Convention on Biological Diversity, agreed on 20 biodiversity-related “Aichi Targets” to be achieved within a decade. We provide a comprehensive mid-term assessment of progress toward these global targets using 55 indicator data sets. We projected indicator trends to 2020 using an adaptive statistical framework that incorporated the specific properties of individual time series. On current trajectories, results suggest that despite accelerating policy and management responses to the biodiversity crisis, the impacts of these efforts are unlikely to be reflected in improved trends in the state of biodiversity by 2020. We highlight areas of societal endeavor requiring additional efforts to achieve the Aichi Targets, and provide a baseline against which to assess future progress.

            Indicators of progress and decline
            
              The targets set by the Convention on Biological Diversity in 2010 focused international efforts to alleviate global biodiversity decline. However, many of the consequences of these efforts will not be evident by the 2020 deadline agreed to by governments of 150 countries. Tittensor
              et al.
              analyzed data on 55 different biodiversity indicators to predict progress toward the 2020 targets—indicators such as protected area coverage, land-use trends, and endangered species status. The analysis pinpoints the problems and areas that will need the most attention in the next few years.

	abstract = {Surface-tethered particle interceptor traps (PITs) were deployed at 50 and 100 m (1–3 days) on ten occasions in the Cariaco Basin between March 2007 and November 2009 to measure the settling ﬂuxes of biogenic particles at 50 m (the base of the euphotic zone—Ez) and 100 m. Fluxes at these two depths were compared to concurrent ﬂuxes estimated with moored sediment traps at 150, 225 and 410 m from the CARIACO Ocean Time-Series program. We measured particulate organic carbon (POC), particulate organic nitrogen (PON), calcium carbonate, biogenic silica and terrigenous material concentrations in samples collected with both the drifting and moored traps. We also estimated the ﬂuxes of foraminifera shells and coccolithophore cells at 50 and 100 m using drifting traps samples. Surface chlorophyll a and primary production observations during each sampling period were examined to quantify the relationship between the magnitude and geochemical composition of the vertical ﬂux and overlying production. Surface chlorophyll a concentrations and primary production rates were highest during months of upwelling (2.58 À 1.35 mg mÀ3 and 3.6 À 1.4 g C mÀ2 dÀ1, respectively). The ﬂuxes of POC, PON, calcite and silica measured during the upwelling season (December–May) were typically higher than during the period of non-upwelling (August–November), when surface waters are more strongly stratiﬁed. POC ﬂuxes measured with the drifting traps (50 and 100 m) varied between 0.95 (upwelling) and 0.14 g mÀ2 dÀ1 (non-upwelling), compared with those from the moored traps (150, 225 and 410 m) which ranged from 0.21 to 0.01 g mÀ2 dÀ1. Similarly, the ﬂuxes of biogenic opal in the upper 100 m ranged from 1.12 and 0.18 g mÀ2 dÀ1, and those at greater depths varied from 0.27 g mÀ2 dÀ1 during upwelling to values near zero during stratiﬁcation periods. The ﬂuxes of POC, PON, calcite and silica in the upper 100 m decreased by an order of magnitude at the depth of the oxic–anoxic interface ( 4200 m). The sinking organic matter collected with the ﬂoating traps within the upper 100 m was signiﬁcantly correlated with surface chlorophyll a concentrations (r ¼ 0.68, p o0.05) as a result of close coupling between the ﬂux of biogenic particles and primary production. In contrast, there was no clear relationship between surface chlorophyll/primary production and ﬂuxes measured below 150 m depth.},

Climate changedriven trends need to be accurately assessed and detected in a timely manner. As part of the effort towards detection of long-term trends, a network of ocean observatories and time series stations provide high quality data for a number of key parameters, such as pH, oxygen concentration or primary production (PP). Here, we use an ensemble of global coupled climate models to assess the temporal and spatial scales over which observations of eight biogeochemically relevant variables must be made to robustly detect a long-term trend. We ﬁnd that, as a global average, continuous time series are required for between 14 (pH) and 32 (PP) years to distinguish a climate change trend from natural variability. Regional differences are extensive, with low latitudes and the Arctic generally needing shorter time series ({\textless}{\textasciitilde}30 years) to detect trends than other areas. In addition, we quantify the ‘footprint’ of existing and planned time series stations, that is the area over which a station is representative of a broader region. Footprints are generally largest for pH and sea surface temperature, but nevertheless the existing network of observatories only represents 9–15\% of the global ocean surface. Our results present a quantitative framework for assessing the adequacy of current and future ocean observing networks for detection and monitoring of climate change-driven responses in the marine ecosystem.},

The oceans have partly managed to buffer these multiple pressures, but every single area of the oceans is now affected to some degree by human activities. Chemical properties, biogeochemical cycles and food-webs have been altered with consequences for all marine living organisms. Knowledge on these pressures and associated responses mainly originate from analyses of a few long-term monitoring time series as well as spatially scattered data from various sources. Although the interpretation of these data can be improved by models, there is still a fundamental lack of information and knowledge if scientists are to predict more accurately the effects of human activities. Scientists provide expert advices to society about marine system governance, but such advices should rest on a solid base of observations. Nevertheless, many monitoring programs around the world are currently facing ﬁnancial reduction. Marine ecosystem services are already overexploited in some areas and sustainable use of these services can only be devised on a solid scientiﬁc basis, which requires more observations than presently available.},

	abstract = {Background: The question of how many marine species exist is important because it provides a metric for how much we do and do not know about life in the oceans. We have compiled the ﬁrst register of the marine species of the world and used this baseline to estimate how many more species, partitioned among all major eukaryotic groups, may be discovered.
Results: There are w226,000 eukaryotic marine species described. More species were described in the past decade (w20,000) than in any previous one. The number of authors describing new species has been increasing at a faster rate than the number of new species described in the past six decades. We report that there are w170,000 synonyms, that 58,000–72,000 species are collected but not yet described, and that 482,000–741,000 more species have yet to be sampled. Molecular methods may add tens of thousands of cryptic species. Thus, there may be 0.7–1.0 million marine species. Past rates of description of new species indicate there may be 0.5 6 0.2 million marine species. On average 37\% (median 31\%) of species in over 100 recent ﬁeld studies around the world might be new to science.
Conclusions: Currently, between one-third and two-thirds of marine species may be undescribed, and previous estimates of there being well over one million marine species appear highly unlikely. More species than ever before are being described annually by an increasing number of authors. If the current trend continues, most species will be discovered this century.},

The selectivity supposedly generated by altered resource ratios is re-examined. It is argued that ratios explain very little of the distribution of species with respect to trophy. However, changing nutrient loading does have consequential impacts on the availability of other requirements including light and carbon dioxide. It is argued that the trophic spectrum is not a single dimension of a single factor but, rather, a template of factors covarying in consequence of the larger levels of biomass that are supported, and which weight in favour of the growth and survival prospects of particular kinds of planktonic algae. The trophic spectrum is a probabalistic outcome of several dimensions of variability.},

The two fluxes are critically dependent on geophysical processes that determine mixed-layer depth, nutrient fluxes to and within the ocean, and food-web structure. Because the average turnover time of phytoplankton carbon in the ocean is on the order of a week or less, total and export production are extremely sensitive to external forcing and consequently are seldom in steady state. Elucidating the biogeochemical controls and feedbacks on primary production is essential to understanding how oceanic biota responded to and affected natural climatic variability in the geological past, and will respond to anthropogenically influenced changes in coming decades. One of the most crucial feedbacks results from changes in radiative forcing on the hydrological cycle, which influences the aeolian iron flux and, in turn, affects nitrogen fixation and primary production in the oceans.},

We use time series data on species abundance and environmental conditions in northeast Pacific systems to explore physicalbiological linkages underlying ecosystem structure and function, as well as the mechanisms driving stability and change over time. We classify species to diet-based functional guilds and explore the extent to which species within and between guilds exhibit common responses to environmental variables. We also distinguish distinct environmental thresholds for individual species, quantify how habitat variables influence the structuring of biological communities, and examine how trends in climate might influence shifts in community composition, range, and species dominance. Patterns suggest that habitat constraints and environmental thresholds influence guilds in distinct ways. Despite distinctions in physical and biological structure across systems, we note common trends in species dynamics within functional guilds, providing insight to common patterns and potential responses to climate change in these systems.},

Methods such as random forests already exist to assess predictor importance for individual species and to indicate where along gradients abundance changes. However, there is a need to extend these methods to whole assemblages, to establish where along the range of these gradients the important compositional changes occur, and to identify any important thresholds or change points. We develop such a method, called ‘‘gradient forest,’’ which is an extension of the random forest approach. By synthesizing the cross-validated R2 and accuracy importance measures from univariate random forest analyses across multiple species, sampling devices, and surveys, gradient forest obtains a monotonic function of each predictor that represents the compositional turnover along the gradient of the predictor. When applied to a synthetic data set, the method correctly identiﬁed the important predictors and delineated where the compositional change points occurred along these gradients. Application of gradient forest to a real data set from part of the Great Barrier Reef identiﬁed mud fraction of the sediment as the most important predictor, with highest compositional turnover occurring at mud fraction values around 25\%, and provided similar information for other predictors. Such reﬁned information allows for more accurate capturing of biodiversity patterns for the purposes of bioregionalization, delineation of protected areas, or designing of biodiversity surveys.},

            The future response of marine ecosystem diversity to continued anthropogenic forcing is poorly constrained. Phytoplankton are a diverse set of organisms that form the base of the marine ecosystem. Currently, ocean biogeochemistry and ecosystem models used for climate change projections typically include only 2−3 phytoplankton types and are, therefore, too simple to adequately assess the potential for changes in plankton community structure. Here, we analyse a complex ecosystem model with 35 phytoplankton types to evaluate the changes in phytoplankton community composition, turnover and size structure over the 21st century. We find that the rate of turnover in the phytoplankton community becomes faster during this century, that is, the community structure becomes increasingly unstable in response to climate change. Combined with alterations to phytoplankton diversity, our results imply a loss of ecological resilience with likely knock-on effects on the productivity and functioning of the marine environment.},

Although there is emerging consensus that diversity enhances productivity and stability in communities of higher organisms; however, we still do not know whether these relationships apply also for communities of unicellular organisms, such as phytoplankton, which contribute ≈50\% to the global primary production. We show here that phytoplankton resource use, and thus carbon fixation, is directly linked to the diversity of phytoplankton communities. Datasets from freshwater and brackish habitats show that diversity is the best predictor for resource use efficiency of phytoplankton communities across considerable environmental gradients. Furthermore, we show that the diversity requirement for stable ecosystem functioning scales with the nutrient level (total phosphorus), as evidenced by the opposing effects of diversity (negative) and resource level (positive) on the variability of both resource use and community composition. Our analyses of large-scale observational data are consistent with experimental and model studies demonstrating causal effects of microbial diversity on functional properties at the system level. Our findings point at potential linkages between eutrophication and pollution-mediated loss of phytoplankton diversity. Factors reducing phytoplankton diversity may have direct detrimental effects on the amount and predictability of aquatic primary production.},

Basin-scale ocean dynamic processes such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation connect the physical, climate-related variability to changes in phytoplankton distribution and amount. Thus, improving the reliability of forecasts of large-scale ocean dynamics may help to improve predictions of changes in ocean community ecology.

          , 
            Phytoplankton—the microalgae that populate the upper lit layers of the ocean—fuel the oceanic food web and affect oceanic and atmospheric carbon dioxide levels through photosynthetic carbon fixation. Here, we show that multidecadal changes in global phytoplankton abundances are related to basin-scale oscillations of the physical ocean, specifically the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. This relationship is revealed in {\textasciitilde}20 years of satellite observations of chlorophyll and sea surface temperature. Interaction between the main pycnocline and the upper ocean seasonal mixed layer is one mechanism behind this correlation. Our findings provide a context for the interpretation of contemporary changes in global phytoplankton and should improve predictions of their future evolution with climate change.},

Their inﬂuence on seasonal and inter-annual variability of phytoplankton has been documented in the recent literature. Here, we decipher the long-term variability of phytoplankton phenology at a Long-Term Ecological Research site (Gulf of Trieste, Slovenia). Structural changes in the phytoplankton community (period 2005–2017) were analysed using a multivariate protocol based on Bayesian clustering. The protocol was modiﬁed from the literature to ﬁt the needs of the study, using correspondence analysis and k-means clustering. A novel index for ordination and selection of taxa based on frequency and evenness was developed. The Total Inertia analysis showed that this index better preserved the available information. Typical seasonal assemblages were highlighted by applying the Indicative Value index in conjunction with likelihood ratio values. We obtained a rough picture of the seasonal separation of the diatom-dominated community from the mixed community and a reﬁned picture of the phenology of the assemblages and bloom events. The spring diatom peak proved to be inconstant and short-lived, while the autumn bloom was generally long and diverse. As expected for nearshore environments, the average life span of the assemblages was found to be short-periodic (2–4 months). The second part of the year and the last part of the series were more prone to changes in terms of typical assemblages.},

            Because microbial plankton in the ocean comprise diverse bacteria, algae, and protists that are subject to environmental forcing on multiple spatial and temporal scales, a fundamental open question is to what extent these organisms form ecologically cohesive communities. Here we show that although all taxa undergo large, near daily fluctuations in abundance, microbial plankton are organized into clearly defined communities whose turnover is rapid and sharp. We analyze a time series of 93 consecutive days of coastal plankton using a technique that allows inference of communities as modular units of interacting taxa by determining positive and negative correlations at different temporal frequencies. This approach shows both coordinated population expansions that demarcate community boundaries and high frequency of positive and negative associations among populations within communities. Our analysis thus highlights that the environmental variability of the coastal ocean is mirrored in sharp transitions of defined but ephemeral communities of organisms.},

	abstract = {Theory and observations suggest that low frequency variation in marine plankton populations, or red noise, may arise through cumulative integration of white noise atmospheric forcing by the ocean and its ampliﬁcation within food webs. Here, we revisit evidence for the integration of stochastic atmospheric variations by comparing the power spectra of time series of atmospheric and oceanographic conditions to the population dynamics of 150 plankton taxa at Station L4 in the Western English Channel. The power spectra of oceanographic conditions (sea surface temperature, surface nitrate) are redder than those of atmospheric forcing (surface wind stress, net heat ﬂuxes) at Station L4. However, plankton populations have power spectral slopes across trophic levels and body sizes that are redder than atmospheric forcing but whiter than oceanographic conditions. While zooplankton have redder spectral slopes than phytoplankton, there is no signiﬁcant relationship between power spectral slope and body size or generation length. Using a predator−prey model, we show that the whitening of plankton time series relative to oceanographic conditions arises from noisy plankton bloom dynamics in this strongly seasonal system. The model indicates that, for typical predator−prey interactions, where the predator is on average 10 times longer than the prey, grazing leads to a modest reddening of phytoplankton variability by their larger and longer lived zooplankton consumers. Our ﬁndings suggest that, beyond extrinsic forcing by the environment, predator–prey interactions play a role in inﬂuencing the power spectra of time series of plankton populations.},

	abstract = {How diverse are marine planktonic protist communities? How much seasonality do they exhibit? For a very long time, these two old and challenging questions in the field of plankton ecology could be addressed only for large‐size protist species, based on cell counting under the microscope. The recent application of molecular techniques, notably massive marker‐gene amplicon sequencing approaches (metabarcoding), has allowed investigating with unprecedented level of resolution the small‐sized ({\textless}20 µm) planktonic eukaryotes too. An amazing diversity of these tiny organisms has been unveiled but details about their temporal dynamics remain much more elusive. In a From the Cover article in this issue of Molecular Ecology, Giner et al. (2019) introduce a new Recurrence Index (RI) to specifically look for seasonality in time‐series metabarcoding data. They inspected the temporal dynamics of all operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in a rich sequence data set of pico‐ and nanoplanktonic eukaryotes in samples collected monthly during 10 years. Although most OTUs did not show seasonality, some abundant ones did, which explains why some averaging methods can find seasonality at the less detailed level of whole planktonic communities. Not surprisingly, the very complex small‐sized eukaryotic plankton communities are composed of organisms with miscellaneous temporal dynamics.},

Satellite scatterometer wind estimates showed that changes in the wind preceded changes in hydrography by 1–2 weeks. Upward migration of isopleths within the upper 150 m was observed between November and May each year, when the Trade Wind was more intense. A seasonal deepening of the isopleths was observed when winds relaxed. A secondary upwelling event was observed every year between July and August, in response to an intensiﬁcation of the southward component of the Trade Wind. Interannual variation in the upwelling cycle was driven in part by variations in wind intensity and in part by other events at time scales of 1–3 months. The latter were associated with 90–140 m deep intrusions of Caribbean Sea water that forced waters above them to the surface. Satellite-derived sea surface height anomaly maps demonstrated that these events were related to cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies moving along the continental shelf. Waters deeper than 1200 m showed small temperature and salinity increases of 0.00751C yrÀ1 and 0.0016 yrÀ1, consistent with previous estimates.},

Our results indicate that water column degradation of fresh organic matter in this anoxic setting is similar to what has been previously observed in the open ocean. Additionally, the rate at which carbon is consumed increases as primary productivity increases. These ﬁndings support the hypothesis that sulfate reduction is as efﬁcient as aerobic respiration in degrading labile organic matter and that an anoxic water column does not necessarily result in an enhanced delivery of organic carbon to the sea ﬂoor. We estimate that 1–2\% of the organic carbon produced at the surface reaches the seaﬂoor and that approximately 50\% of this is preserved in the sediments. This burial efﬁciency is comparable to that previously reported for both oxic and anoxic settings, and with sedimentation rates similar to that in Cariaco Basin.},

	abstract = {A workshop was held at the University of the West Indies, Jamaica, in May 2012 to build capacity in climate data rescue and to enhance knowledge about climate change in the Caribbean region. Scientists brought their daily observational surface temperature and precipitation data from weather stations for an assessment of quality and homogeneity and for the calculation of climate indices helpful for studying climate change in their region. This study presents the trends in daily and extreme temperature and precipitation indices in the Caribbean region for records spanning the 1961–2010 and 1986–2010 intervals. Overall, the results show a warming of the surface air temperature at land stations. In general, the indices based on minimum temperature show stronger warming trends than indices calculated from maximum temperature. The frequency of warm days, warm nights and extreme high temperatures has increased while fewer cool days, cool nights and extreme low temperatures were found for both periods. Changes in precipitation indices are less consistent and the trends are generally weak. Small positive trends were found in annual total precipitation, daily intensity, maximum number of consecutive dry days and heavy rainfall events particularly during the period 1986–2010. Correlations between indices and the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) index suggest that temperature variability and, to a lesser extent, precipitation extremes are related to the AMO signal of the North Atlantic surface sea temperatures: stronger associations are found in August and September for the temperature indices and in June and October for some of the precipitation indices.},

	abstract = {Multidecadal variability in the Atlantic Ocean and its importance to the Earth's climate system has been the subject of study in the physical oceanography ﬁeld for decades. Only recently, however, has the importance of this variability, termed the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation or AMO, been recognized by ecologists as an important factor inﬂuencing ecosystem state. A growing body of literature suggests that AMO-related ﬂuctuations are associated with shifts in ecological boundaries, primary productivity, and a number of ecologically and economically important coastal and marine populations across the Atlantic basin. Although the AMO is a basin-wide index of SST, the drivers of ecosystem change encompass more than temperature anomalies and the mode of action differs within each ecosystem. A common theme in assessing ecosystem change indicates that ﬂuctuations in water masses and circulation patterns drive shifts in ecosystem states, but the magnitude and rate of change is dependent on the physical characteristics of the region. Because of the wide ranging geographic effects of the AMO, and considering its multidecadal nature, a more complete understanding of its causes and effects would allow scientists and managers to more effectively inform ecosystem-based management across the Atlantic Basin.},

Much more activity occurs in the Caribbean with La Nin˜ a conditions than with El Nin˜ o conditions. On the multidecadal time scale, the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation is shown to play a signiﬁcant role in Caribbean hurricane activity, likely linked to its close relationship with multidecadal alterations in the size of the Atlantic warm pool and the phase of the Atlantic meridional mode. When El Nin˜ o–Southern Oscillation and the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation are examined in combination, even stronger relationships are found due to a combination of either favorable or unfavorable dynamic and thermodynamic factors. For example, 29 hurricanes tracked into the Caribbean in the 10 strongest La Nin˜ a years in a positive Atlantic multidecadal oscillation period compared with only two hurricanes tracking through the Caribbean in the 10 strongest El Nin˜ o years in a negative Atlantic multidecadal oscillation period.},

              , diatoms relative abundance is reduced by more than 10\% at the global scale and by up to 60\% in the North Atlantic and in the subantarctic Pacific. This simulated change in the ecosystem structure impacts oceanic carbon uptake by reducing the efficiency of the biological pump, thus contributing to the positive feedback between climate change and the ocean carbon cycle. However, our model simulations do not identify this biological mechanism as a first‐order process in the response of ocean carbon uptake to climate change.},

	abstract = {A continuous, 13-yr record of environmental data and phytoplankton species and assemblage structure in the mesohaline Neuse River Estuary (biweekly, April–October; monthly, November–March) was used to evaluate phytoplankton assemblage responses to changing environmental conditions. Ordination techniques including nonmetric multidimensional scaling, indicator species analysis, and BIO-ENV software were used to investigate potential environmental predictors of phytoplankton assemblage patterns under chronic eutrophication. Phytoplankton assemblages were strongly related to temperature and total nitrogen : total phosphorus ratios, with expected seasonal changes in species composition. Interannual changes in river discharge influenced whether phytoplankton assemblages were dominated by diatoms and phototrophic flagellates or by mixotrophic and heterotrophic dinoflagellates. Increasing ammonium concentrations also have been an important influence on phytoplankton assemblages. Raphidophytes (including the potentially toxic species Heterosigma akashiwo), haptophytes, chlorophytes, and the bloom-forming dinoflagellate Heterocapsa rotundata have increased in more recent years (2000–2006), concomitant with increasing ammonium concentrations. Abundance of the potentially toxic dinoflagellates Prorocentrum minimum and the grouping Pfiesteria spp., ‘‘pfiesteria-like’’ dinoflagellates, and Karlodinium veneficum remained stationary over time and rarely exceeded 103 cells mL21. Abundance of P. minimum was positively related to dissolved organic nitrogen and suspended solids concentrations, whereas the highest abundance of the grouping Pfiesteria spp., ‘‘pfiesteria-like’’ dinoflagellates, and K. veneficum occurred during summer and fall, related to high total phosphorus concentrations, temperature, and salinity. Overall, this study provides new species-level insights to advance understanding about anthropogenic influences on phytoplankton assemblages. The data suggest an increasingly important role of ammonium in controlling phytoplankton assemblage structure, including increased abundance of some harmful species, in eutrophic estuaries.},

	abstract = {We examined the variability of sea surface carbon dioxide fugacity (fCO2sea) and its relation to temperature at the Cariaco Basin ocean time-series location (101300N, 641400W) for the period from 1996 through 2008. Periods of warm (positive) and cold (negative) anomalies at the station were related to variability in coastal upwelling intensity. A positive temporal trend in monthlydeseasonalized sea surface temperatures (SST) was observed, leading to an overall increase of 1.13 1C over 13 years. Surface fCO2sea displayed signiﬁcant short-term variation (month to month) with a range of 330–445 matm. In addition to a large seasonal range (58 7 17 matm), deseasonalized fCO2sea data showed an interannual positive trend of 1.77 7 0.43 matm yrÀ1. In the Cariaco Basin, positive and negative anomalies of temperature and fCO2sea are in phase. An increase/decrease of 1 1C coincides with an increase/decrease of 16–20 matm of fCO2sea. Deseasonalized fCO2sea normalized to 26.05 1C, the mean Cariaco SST, shows a lower rate of increase (0.51 7 0.49 matm yrÀ1). Based on these observations, 72\% of the increase in fCO2sea in Cariaco Basin between 1996 and 2008 can be attributed to an increasing temperature trend of surface waters, making this the primary factor controlling fugacity at this location. During this period, a decrease in upwelling intensity was also observed. The phytoplankton community changed from large diatom-dominated blooms during upwelling in the late 1990’s to blooms dominated by smaller cells in the ﬁrst decade of the 21st century. The average net sea-air CO2 ﬂux over the study period is 2.0 7 2.6 mol C mÀ2 yrÀ1 employing the Wanninkhof parameterization, and 2.1 72.5 mol C mÀ2 yrÀ1 based on Nightingale’s model. To further understand the connection between the changes observed in the Cariaco Basin, the relationships between interannual variability in the temperature anomaly with three modes of climate variability (AMO, NAO and ENSO) were examined. The correlations between SSTA and two of these climate modes (AMO and ENSO) only show very weak relationships, although they were signiﬁcant.},

Rather, POC fluxes in all three areas strongly correlate with mineral (carbonate, opal, and lithogenic material) fluxes. This supports the “mineral ballast” hypothesis, where it has been suggested that higher‐density minerals enhance the flux of organic matter to the deep ocean. On the basis of multiple regression analysis, the three mineral components explain 72\% of the total variance in POC fluxes at the three study sites, with biogenic carbonate particles being the most effective transport mineral.},

Phytoplankton resource use efﬁciency (RUE = biomass per unit resource) was negatively related to phytoplankton evenness (measured as Pielou’s evenness), whereas zooplankton RUE was positively related to phytoplankton evenness. Phytoplankton and zooplankton RUE were high and low, respectively, when Cyanobacteria, especially Microcystis sp., dominated. Phytoplankton communities displayed slower community turnover rates when dominated by few genera. Our ﬁndings, which counter ﬁndings of many terrestrial studies, suggest that Cyanobacteria dominance may play important roles in ecosystem functioning and community turnover in nutrient-enriched lakes.},

              The fossil record of marine invertebrates has long fuelled the debate as to whether or not there are limits to global diversity in the sea
              1–5
              . Ecological theory states that, as diversity grows and ecological niches are filled, the strengthening of biological interactions imposes limits on diversity
              6,7
              . However, the extent to which biological interactions have constrained the growth of diversity over evolutionary time remains an open question
              1–5,8–11
              . Here we present a regional diversification model that reproduces the main Phanerozoic eon trends in the global diversity of marine invertebrates after imposing mass extinctions. We find that the dynamics of global diversity are best described by a diversification model that operates widely within the exponential growth regime of a logistic function. A spatially resolved analysis of the ratio of diversity to carrying capacity reveals that less than 2\% of the global flooded continental area throughout the Phanerozoic exhibits diversity levels approaching ecological saturation. We attribute the overall increase in global diversity during the Late Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras to the development of diversity hotspots under prolonged conditions of Earth system stability and maximum continental fragmentation.

              Marine phytoplankton generate half of global primary production, making them essential to ecosystem functioning and biogeochemical cycling. Though phytoplankton are phylogenetically diverse, studies rarely designate unique thermal traits to different taxa, resulting in coarse representations of phytoplankton thermal responses. Here we assessed phytoplankton functional responses to temperature using empirically derived thermal growth rates from four principal contributors to marine productivity: diatoms, dinoflagellates, cyanobacteria, and coccolithophores. Using modeled sea surface temperatures for 1950–1970 and 2080–2100, we explored potential alterations to each group’s growth rates and geographical distribution under a future climate change scenario. Contrary to the commonly applied Eppley formulation, our data suggest phytoplankton functional types may be characterized by different temperature coefficients (Q
              10
              ), growth maxima thermal dependencies, and thermal ranges which would drive dissimilar responses to each degree of temperature change. These differences, when applied in response to global simulations of future temperature, result in taxon-specific projections of growth and geographic distribution, with low-latitude coccolithophores facing considerable decreases and cyanobacteria substantial increases in growth rates. These results suggest that the singular effect of changing temperature may alter phytoplankton global community structure, owing to the significant variability in thermal response between phytoplankton functional types.},

                  Global concern about human impact on biological diversity has triggered an intense research agenda on drivers and consequences of biodiversity change in parallel with international policy seeking to conserve biodiversity and associated ecosystem functions. Quantifying the trends in biodiversity is far from trivial, however, as recently documented by meta‐analyses, which report little if any net change in local species richness through time.
                
                
                  Here, we summarise several limitations of species richness as a metric of biodiversity change and show that the expectation of directional species richness trends under changing conditions is invalid. Instead, we illustrate how a set of species turnover indices provide more information content regarding temporal trends in biodiversity, as they reflect how dominance and identity shift in communities over time.
                
                
                  We apply these metrics to three monitoring datasets representing different ecosystem types. In all datasets, nearly complete species turnover occurred, but this was disconnected from any species richness trends. Instead, turnover was strongly influenced by changes in species presence (identities) and dominance (abundances). We further show that these metrics can detect phases of strong compositional shifts in monitoring data and thus identify a different aspect of biodiversity change decoupled from species richness.
                
                
                  
                    Synthesis and applications
                    : Temporal trends in species richness are insufficient to capture key changes in biodiversity in changing environments. In fact, reductions in environmental quality can lead to transient increases in species richness if immigration or extinction has different temporal dynamics. Thus, biodiversity monitoring programmes need to go beyond analyses of trends in richness in favour of more meaningful assessments of biodiversity change.

            The extent to which biodiversity change in local assemblages contributes to global biodiversity loss is poorly understood. We analyzed 100 time series from biomes across Earth to ask how diversity within assemblages is changing through time. We quantified patterns of temporal α diversity, measured as change in local diversity, and temporal β diversity, measured as change in community composition. Contrary to our expectations, we did not detect systematic loss of α diversity. However, community composition changed systematically through time, in excess of predictions from null models. Heterogeneous rates of environmental change, species range shifts associated with climate change, and biotic homogenization may explain the different patterns of temporal α and β diversity. Monitoring and understanding change in species composition should be a conservation priority.},

	abstract = {We used natural phytoplankton communities from four coastal regions to test diversity-functioning relationships, relations of N2-ﬁxing cyanobacteria to nutrient imbalance, and the importance of metacommunity dynamics. Resource availability was measured as total nitrogen and phosphorus. Resource imbalance was determined as (1) the ratio of dissolved inorganic nitrogen to total phosphorus and (2) an experimentally veriﬁed indicator quantiﬁed by modelling responses in 14C-based primary production to nutrient additions. Resource availability explained variance in biomass, productivity, and species richness, as expected by the Species Energy Theory, but not evenness. Linear mixed-effects models conﬁrmed the overall relation between productivity and resource availability, whereas other resource availability relations showed also notable clustering by region. The Resource Ratio Theory predicting that diversity increases with the number of limiting resources was not supported. Nutrient imbalance had a weak effect on the biomass of N2-ﬁxing cyanobacteria, but not their share of total phytoplankton biomass. Contrary to many previous studies on biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships, we found a highly signiﬁcant inverse relationship between evenness and biomass. This indicates that species-rich natural phytoplankton communities form the basis for opportunistic species to temporarily monopolize resources and create blooms. The result was consistent across regions, although their community composition differed. Metacommunity dynamics were important, since distance between the regions explained higher percentage of the variability than local resources together. As the species able to monopolize resources vary widely in their role for aquatic food webs and environmental consequences (e.g., food quality, toxicity), species-level trait data is essential to understand better diversity-productivity relationships.},

However, this link can differ between taxonomic and functional diversity components and also across trophic levels. These relationships have been hardly studied in planktonic communities of coastal upwelling systems. Using a 28-year time series of phytoplankton and zooplankton assemblages, we examined the effects of phytoplankton diversity on resource use efﬁciency (RUE, ratio of biomass to limiting resource) at the two trophic levels in the Galician upwelling system (NW Iberian peninsula). By ﬁtting generalized least square models, we show that phytoplankton diversity was the best predictor for RUE across planktonic trophic levels. This link varied depending on the biodiversity component considered: while the effect of phytoplankton richness on RUE was positive for phytoplankton RUE and negative for zooplankton RUE, phytoplankton evenness effect was negative for phytoplankton RUE and positive for zooplankton RUE. Overall, taxonomic diversity had higher explanatory power than functional diversity, and variability in phytoplankton and zooplankton RUE decreased with increasing phytoplankton taxonomic diversity. Phytoplankton used resources more efﬁciently in warmer waters and at greater upwelling intensity, although these effects were not as strong as those for biodiversity. These results suggest that phytoplankton species numbers in highly dynamic upwelling systems are important for maintaining the planktonic biomass production leading us to hypothesize the relevance of complementarity effects. However, we further postulate that a selection effect may operate also because assemblages with low evenness were dominated by diatoms with speciﬁc functional traits increasing their ability to exploit resources more efﬁciently.},

	abstract = {The oceans are changing more rapidly than ever before. Unprecedented climatic variability is interacting with unmistakable long-term trends, all against a backdrop of intensifying human activities. What remains unclear, however, is how to evaluate whether conditions have changed sufﬁciently to provoke major responses of species, habitats, and communities. We developed a framework based on multimodel inference to deﬁne ecosystem-based thresholds for human and environmental pressures in the California Current marine ecosystem. To demonstrate how to apply the framework, we explored two decades of data using gradient forest and generalized additive model analyses, screening for nonlinearities and potential threshold responses of ecosystem states (n = 9) across environmental (n = 6) and human (n = 10) pressures. These analyses identiﬁed the existence of threshold responses of ﬁve ecosystem states to four environmental and two human pressures. Both methods agreed on threshold relationships in two cases: (1) the winter copepod anomaly and habitat modiﬁcation, and (2) sea lion pup production and the summer mode of the Paciﬁc Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Considered collectively, however, these alternative analytical approaches imply that as many as ﬁve of the nine ecosystem states may exhibit threshold changes in response to negative PDO values in the summer (copepods, scavengers, groundﬁsh, and marine mammals). This result is consistent with the idea that the inﬂuence of the PDO extends across multiple trophic levels, but extends current knowledge by deﬁning the nonlinear nature of these responses. This research provides a new way to interpret changes in the intensities of human and environmental pressures as they relate to the ecological integrity of the California Current ecosystem. These insights can be used to make more informed assessments of when and under what conditions intervention, preparation, and mitigation may enhance progress toward ecosystem-based management goals.},

Physical structure and drivers combine with biological responses and interactions to organize marine systems in unique ways at multiple scales. We apply multivariate statistical methods to deﬁne spatially coherent ecological units or ecoregions in the eastern Bering Sea. We also illustrate a practical approach to integrate data on species distribution, habitat structure and physical forcing mechanisms to distinguish areas with distinct biogeography as one means to deﬁne management units in large marine ecosystems. We use random forests to quantify the relative importance of habitat and environmental variables to the distribution of individual species, and to quantify shifts in multispecies assemblages or community composition along environmental gradients. Threshold shifts in community composition are used to identify regions with distinct physical and biological attributes, and to evaluate the relative importance of predictor variables to determining regional boundaries. Depth, bottom temperature and frontal boundaries were dominant factors delineating distinct biological communities in this system, with a latitudinal divide at approximately 601N. Our results indicate that distinct climatic periods will shift habitat gradients and that dynamic physical variables such as temperature and stratiﬁcation are important to understanding temporal stability of ecoregion boundaries. We note distinct distribution patterns among functional guilds and also evidence for resource partitioning among individual species within each guild. By integrating physical and biological data to determine spatial patterns in community composition, we partition ecosystems along ecologically signiﬁcant gradients. This may provide a basis for deﬁning spatial management units or serve as a baseline index for analyses of structural shifts in the physical environment, species abundance and distribution, and community dynamics over time.},

	abstract = {Understanding environmental driver-response relationships is critical to the implementation of effective ecosystembased management. Ecosystems are often inﬂuenced by multiple drivers that operate on different timescales and may be nonstationary. In turn, contrasting views of ecosystem state and structure could arise depending on the temporal perspective of analysis. Further, assessment of multiple ecosystem components (e.g., biological indicators) may serve to identify different key drivers and connections. To explore how the timescale of analysis and data richness can inﬂuence the identiﬁcation of driver-response relationships within a large, dynamic ecosystem, this study analyzed long-term (1969–2018) data from Lake Erie (USA–Canada). Data were compiled on multiple biological, physical, chemical, and socioeconomic components of the ecosystem to quantify trends and identify potential key drivers during multiple time intervals (20 to 50 years duration), using zooplankton, bird, and ﬁsh community metrics as indicators of ecosystem change. Concurrent temporal shifts of many variables occurred during the 1980s, but asynchronous dynamics were evident among indicator taxa. The strengths and rank orders of predictive drivers shifted among intervals and were sometimes taxon-speciﬁc. Drivers related to nutrient loading and lake trophic status were consistently strong predictors of temporal patterns for all indicators; however, within the longer intervals, measures of agricultural land use were the strongest predictors, whereas within shorter intervals, the stronger predictors were measures of tributary or in-lake nutrient concentrations. Physical drivers also tended to increase in predictive ability within shorter intervals. The results highlight how the time interval examined can ﬁlter inﬂuences of lower-frequency, slower drivers and higher-frequency, faster drivers. Understanding ecosystem change in support of ecosystem-based management requires consideration of both the temporal perspective of analysis and the chosen indicators, as both can inﬂuence which drivers are identiﬁed as most predictive of ecosystem trends at that timescale.},

The shape of the diversity–functioning relationship varies along with variations in environmental drivers, which is of highest importance for ongoing discussions about impacts of global change on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.},

	abstract = {This paper analyses the life strategies, the dominance patterns and the diversity in phytoplankton communities in large and deep lakes. The study was carried out on the largest Italian Lake (Lake Garda) from 1995 to 2000. Different statistical analyses were applied. For phytoplankton the time variable represents a complex environmental gradient driving annual succession; this gradient was made explicit by the application of PCA analyses to the environmental data. The use of Non Metric Multi Dimensional Scaling applied to Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrices revealed an ordered and cyclic development of phytoplankton every year; the Bray-Curtis index, calculated between pairs of chronologically contiguous samples, was also used as a measure of the community change rate (βt) over the temporal succession. A signiﬁcant relationship between βt and the complex environmental gradient was assessed. Finally, for every phytoplankton species, the optimum conditions for growth and the realised niches were determined. The positioning of the species on the complex environmental gradient, and the contemporaneous application of cluster analysis based on the different speciﬁc environmental optima, highlighted primarily the existence of two groups at the extreme of the complex environmental gradient. The ﬁrst group included the large late winter/spring diatoms, which developed during high water turbulence and strong physical control, high nutrient concentrations, low light conditions and reduced competition. The second group was composed by many heterogeneous summer species characterised by the ability to contrast losses by grazing and sinking in stratiﬁed and stable conditions, and the ability of tolerating nutrient deﬁciency. A third group of species developed during environmental conditions in the middle of the two previous extremes. These included the three master species Mougeotia sp., Fragilaria crotonensis and Planktothrix rubescens/agardhii. The endogenous and exogenous mechanisms promoting species coexistence are discussed, along with the applicability of competitive and equilibrium/non-equilibrium theories to phytoplankton dynamics.},

Increased demand for living marine resources has resulted in global declines of targeted species, which are often managed under a single-species paradigm that does not fully incorporate ecosystem considerations such as ecological interactions or environmental factors. Ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) is a more holistic approach that concurrently addresses human, ecological, and environmental factors influencing living marine resources and evaluates these considerations collectively on a system level. For EBFM, reference points associated with management action need to be quantified. Methods have been developed to assign decision criteria to ecological indicators’ response to human-use pressures, yet few efforts have established decision criteria in response to the combined influence of humanuse and environmental pressures. We translated ecological indicator response into a surface dependent on both fishing and environmental pressures. Using generalized additive models, we empirically determined critical points at which a small change in fishing and environmental pressure results in an abrupt change in ecosystem status. For the Northeast United States Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem, we identified critical points in ecological indicators that represent system production, size distribution, community structure, and ecosystem functioning. Our findings highlight the need to include both anthropogenic and environmental pressures for delineation of ecosystem decision criteria.},

Recent development and application of Landsat time series analysis oﬀers unique opportunities for quantifying seasonality and trend components among diﬀerent forest types for developing alternative feature sets for forest vegetation mapping. Within a large forested landscape in Southeastern Ohio, USA, we examined the use of harmonic metrics developed from time series of all available Landsat-8 observations (2013–2019) relative to seasonal image composites, including accompanying spectral components and vegetation indices. A reference dataset among three sources was integrated and used to categorize forest inventory data into seven forest type classes and gradient compositional response. Results showed that the combination of harmonic metrics and topographic variables achieved an accuracy agreement with the reference data of 74.9\% relative to seasonal composites (71.6\%) and spectral indices (70.3\%). Diﬀerences in agreement were attributed to improved discrimination of three heterogeneous upland hardwood classes and an early-successional, young forest class, all forest types of primary interest among managers across the region. Variable importance metrics often identiﬁed the cosine and sine terms that quantify the seasonality in spectral values in the harmonic feature space, suggesting these aspects best support the characterization of forest types at greater thematic detail than seasonal compositing procedures. This study demonstrates how advanced time series metrics can improve forest type modeling and forest gradient quantiﬁcations, thus showcasing a need for continued exploration of such approaches across diﬀerent forest types.},

We applied genotyping by sequencing and derived 2,583 single nucleotide polymorphism markers genotyped from 81 individuals across 17 sites in the studied region. We implemented an approach based on the nearest neighbour haplotype ‘coancestry’ and uncovered a weak population structure along an east–­west climatic gradient across the Mediterranean region. We identified genomic regions potentially involved in local adaptation and predicted differences in the genetic composition across the landscape under current and future climates. Variants associated with temperature and precipitation variables were detected, and we applied a nonlinear multivariate association method, gradient forest, to project these gene–­environment relationships across space. The model allowed the identification of geographic areas within the western Mediterranean region most sensitive to climate change: south-­western Iberia and northern Morocco.

	abstract = {Temporal environmental fluctuations, such as seasonality, exert strong controls on biodiversity. While the effects of seasonality are well known, the predictability of fluctuations across years may influence seasonality in ways that are less well understood. The ability of a habitat to support unique, non-n­ ested assemblages of species at different times of the year should depend on both seasonality (occurrence of events at specific periods of the year) and predictability (the reliability of event recurrence) of characteristic ecological conditions. Drawing on tools from wavelet analysis and information theory, we developed a framework for quantifying both seasonality and predictability of habitats, and applied this using global long-­term rainfall data. Our analysis predicted that temporal beta diversity should be maximized in highly predictable and highly seasonal climates, and that low degrees of seasonality, predictability, or both would lower diversity in characteristic ways. Using stream invertebrate communities as a case study, we demonstrated that temporal species diversity, as exhibited by community turnover, was determined by a balance between temporal environmental variability (seasonality) and the reliability of this variability (predictability). Communities in highly seasonal mediterranean environments exhibited strong oscillations in community structure, with turnover from one unique community type to another across seasons, whereas communities in aseasonal New Zealand environments fluctuated randomly. Understanding the influence of seasonal and other temporal scales of environmental oscillations on diversity is not complete without a clear understanding of their predictability, and our framework provides tools for examining these trends at a variety of temporal scales, seasonal and beyond. Given the uncertainty of future climates, seasonality and predictability are critical considerations for both basic science and management of ecosystems (e.g., dam operations, bioassessment) spanning gradients of climatic variability.},

              1.
               Environmental variables are often used as indirect surrogates for mapping biodiversity because species survey data are scant at regional scales, especially in the marine realm. However, environmental variables are measured on arbitrary scales unlikely to have simple, direct relationships with biological patterns. Instead, biodiversity may respond nonlinearly and to interactions between environmental variables.
            
            
              2.
               To investigate the role of the environment in driving patterns of biodiversity composition in large marine regions, we collated multiple biological survey and environmental data sets from tropical NE Australia, the deep Gulf of Mexico and the temperate Gulf of Maine. We then quantified the shape and magnitude of multispecies responses along {\textgreater}30 environmental gradients and the extent to which these variables predicted regional distributions. To do this, we applied a new statistical approach,
              Gradient Forest
              , an extension of Random Forest, capable of modelling nonlinear and threshold responses.
            
            
              3.
               The regional‐scale environmental variables predicted an average of 13–35\% (up to 50–85\% for individual species) of the variation in species abundance distributions. Important predictors differed among regions and biota and included depth, salinity, temperature, sediment composition and current stress. The shapes of responses along gradients also differed and were nonlinear, often with thresholds indicative of step changes in composition. These differing regional responses were partly due to differing environmental indicators of bioregional boundaries and, given the results to date, may indicate limited scope for extrapolating bio‐physical relationships beyond the region of source data sets.

Gradient Forest offers a new capability for exploring relationships between biodiversity and environmental gradients, generating new information on multispecies responses at a detail not available previously.

Although their ecological and evolutionary importance has been recognized, the study of their genetic diversity is yet scanty. The main goal of this study was to analyse microbial genetic diversity of microbialites living in different types of environments throughout Mexico, including desert ponds, coastal lagoons and a crater-lake. We followed a pyrosequencing approach of hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene. Results showed that microbialite communities were very diverse (H′ = 6–7) and showed geographic variation in composition, as well as an environmental effect related to pH and conductivity, which together explained 33\% of the genetic variation.

            Community dynamics are central in microbial ecology, yet we lack studies comparing diversity patterns among marine protists and prokaryotes over depth and multiple years. Here, we characterized microbes at the San-Pedro Ocean Time series (2005–2018), using SSU rRNA gene sequencing from two size fractions (0.2–1 and 1–80 μm), with a universal primer set that amplifies from both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, allowing direct comparisons of diversity patterns in a single set of analyses. The 16S + 18S rRNA gene composition in the small size fraction was mostly prokaryotic (\&gt;92\%) as expected, but the large size fraction unexpectedly contained 46–93\% prokaryotic 16S rRNA genes. Prokaryotes and protists showed opposite vertical diversity patterns; prokaryotic diversity peaked at mid-depth, protistan diversity at the surface. Temporal beta-diversity patterns indicated prokaryote communities were much more stable than protists. Although the prokaryotic communities changed monthly, the average community stayed remarkably steady over 14 years, showing high resilience. Additionally, particle-associated prokaryotes were more diverse than smaller free-living ones, especially at deeper depths, contributed unexpectedly by abundant and diverse SAR11 clade II. Eukaryotic diversity was strongly correlated with the diversity of particle-associated prokaryotes but not free-living ones, reflecting that physical associations result in the strongest interactions, including symbioses, parasitism, and decomposer relationships.},

The R package ecodist brings together methods for working with dissimilarities, including some not available in other R packages. We present some of the features of ecodist, particularly simple and partial Mantel tests, and make recommendations for their eﬀective use. Although the partial Mantel test is often used to account for the eﬀects of space, the assumption of linearity greatly reduces its eﬀectiveness for complex spatial patterns. We introduce a modiﬁcation of the Mantel correlogram designed to overcome this restriction and allow consideration of complex nonlinear structures. This extension of the method allows the use of partial multivariate correlograms and tests of relationship between variables at diﬀerent spatial scales. Some of the possibilities are demonstrated using both artiﬁcial data and data from an ongoing study of plant community composition in grazinglands of the northeastern United States.},

Here, we combined long-term monitoring datasets of German and Dutch coastal stations and amended these with additional information on species biomass. Across the integrated and harmonized dataset, we used multiple biodiversity descriptors to analyse temporal trends in the Wadden Sea phytoplankton. Biodiversity, measured as the number of species (S) and the effective number of species (ENS), has decreased in the Dutch stations over the last 20 years, while biomass has increased, indicating that fewer species are becoming more dominant in the system. However, biodiversity and biomass did not show substantial changes in the German stations. Although there were some differences in trends between countries, shifts in community composition and relative abundance were consistent across stations and time. We emphasise the importance of continuous and harmonized monitoring programmes and multi-metric approaches that can detect changes in the communities that are indicative of changes in the environment.},

              Deep-sea benthic foraminifera preserve an essential record of Earth's past climate in their oxygen- and carbon-isotope compositions. However, this record lacks sufficient temporal resolution and/or age control in some places to determine which climate forcing and feedback mechanisms were most important. Westerhold

              present a highly resolved and well-dated record of benthic carbon and oxygen isotopes for the past 66 million years. Their reconstruction and analysis show that Earth's climate can be grouped into discrete states separated by transitions related to changing greenhouse gas levels and the growth of polar ice sheets. Each climate state is paced by orbital cycles but responds to variations in radiative forcing in a state-dependent manner.

            Much of our understanding of Earth’s past climate comes from the measurement of oxygen and carbon isotope variations in deep-sea benthic foraminifera. Yet, long intervals in existing records lack the temporal resolution and age control needed to thoroughly categorize climate states of the Cenozoic era and to study their dynamics. Here, we present a new, highly resolved, astronomically dated, continuous composite of benthic foraminifer isotope records developed in our laboratories. Four climate states—Hothouse, Warmhouse, Coolhouse, Icehouse—are identified on the basis of their distinctive response to astronomical forcing depending on greenhouse gas concentrations and polar ice sheet volume. Statistical analysis of the nonlinear behavior encoded in our record reveals the key role that polar ice volume plays in the predictability of Cenozoic climate dynamics.},

	abstract = {Identifying and characterising dynamical regime shifts, critical transitions or potential tipping points in palaeoclimate time series is relevant for improving the understanding of often highly nonlinear Earth system dynamics. Beyond linear changes in time series properties such as mean, variance, or trend, these nonlinear regime shifts can manifest as changes in signal predictability, regularity, complexity, or higherorder stochastic properties such as multi-stability. In recent years, several classes of methods have been put forward to study these critical transitions in time series data that are based on concepts from nonlinear dynamics, complex systems science, information theory, and stochastic analysis. These include approaches such as phase space-based recurrence plots and recurrence networks, visibility graphs, order pattern-based entropies, and stochastic modelling. Here, we review and compare in detail several prominent methods from these ﬁelds by applying them to the same set of marine palaeoclimate proxy records of African climate variations during the past 5 million years. Applying these methods, we observe notable nonlinear transitions in palaeoclimate dynamics in these marine proxy records and discuss them in the context of important climate events and regimes such as phases of intensiﬁed Walker circulation, marine isotope stage M2, the onset of northern hemisphere glaciation and the mid-Pleistocene transition. We ﬁnd that the studied approaches complement each other by allowing us to point out distinct aspects of dynamical regime shifts in palaeoclimate time series. We also detect signiﬁcant correlations of these nonlinear regime shift indicators with variations of Earth's orbit, suggesting the latter as potential triggers of nonlinear transitions in palaeoclimate. Overall, the presented study underlines the potentials of nonlinear time series analysis approaches to provide complementary information on dynamical regime shifts in palaeoclimate and their driving processes that cannot be revealed by linear statistics or eyeball inspection of the data alone.},

A powerful tool for their visualisation and analysis called recurrence plot was introduced in the late 1980’s. This report is a comprehensive overview covering recurrence based methods and their applications with an emphasis on recent developments. After a brief outline of the theory of recurrences, the basic idea of the recurrence plot with its variations is presented. This includes the quantiﬁcation of recurrence plots, like the recurrence quantiﬁcation analysis, which is highly effective to detect, e. g., transitions in the dynamics of systems from time series. A main point is how to link recurrences to dynamical invariants and unstable periodic orbits. This and further evidence suggest that recurrences contain all relevant information about a system’s behaviour. As the respective phase spaces of two systems change due to coupling, recurrence plots allow studying and quantifying their interaction. This fact also provides us with a sensitive tool for the study of synchronisation of complex systems. In the last part of the report several applications of recurrence plots in economy, physiology, neuroscience, earth sciences, astrophysics and engineering are shown. The aim of this work is to provide the readers with the know how for the application of recurrence plot based methods in their own ﬁeld of research.

	abstract = {Complex systems can, to a ﬁrst approximation, be characterized by the fact that their dynamics emerging at the macroscopic level cannot be easily explained from the microscopic dynamics of the individual constituents of the system. This property of complex systems can be identiﬁed in virtually all natural systems surrounding us, but also in many social, economic, and technological systems. The deﬁning characteristics of complex systems imply that their dynamics can often only be captured from the analysis of simulated or observed data. Here, we summarize recent advances in nonlinear data analysis of both simulated and real-world complex systems, with a focus on recurrence analysis for the investigation of individual or small sets of time series, and complex networks for the analysis of possibly very large, spatiotemporal datasets. We review and explain the recent success of these two key concepts of complexity science with an emphasis on applications for the analysis of geoscientiﬁc and in particular (palaeo-) climate data. In particular, we present several prominent examples where challenging problems in Earth system and climate science have been successfully addressed using recurrence analysis and complex networks. We outline several open questions for future lines of research in the direction of data-based complex system analysis, again with a focus on applications in the Earth sciences, and suggest possible combinations with suitable machine learning approaches. Beyond Earth system analysis, these methods have proven valuable also in many other scientiﬁc disciplines, such as neuroscience, physiology, epidemics, or engineering.},

Even though marked seasonal changes have been reported for whole microbial communities, less is known on the dynamics and seasonality of individual taxa. Here, we aim at understanding microbial recurrence at three different levels: community, taxonomic group and operational taxonomic units (OTUs). For that, we focused on a model microbial eukaryotic community populating a long‐term marine microbial observatory using 18S rRNA gene data from two organismal size fractions: the picoplankton (0.2–3 µm) and the nanoplankton (3–20 µm). We have developed an index to quantify recurrence in particular taxa. We found that community structure oscillated systematically between two main configurations corresponding to winter and summer over the 10 years studied. A few taxonomic groups such as Mamiellophyceae or MALV‐III presented clear recurrence (i.e., seasonality), whereas 13\%–19\% of the OTUs in both size fractions, accounting for {\textasciitilde}40\% of the relative abundance, featured recurrent dynamics. Altogether, our work links longterm whole community dynamics with that of individual OTUs and taxonomic groups, indicating that recurrent and non‐recurrent changes characterize the dynamics of microbial assemblages.},

            The factors regulating phytoplankton community composition play a crucial role in structuring aquatic food webs. However, consensus is still lacking about the mechanisms underlying the observed biogeographical differences in cell size composition of phytoplankton communities. Here we use a trait-based model to disentangle these mechanisms in two contrasting regions of the Atlantic Ocean. In our model, the phytoplankton community can self-assemble based on a trade-off emerging from relationships between cell size and (1) nutrient uptake, (2) zooplankton grazing and (3) phytoplankton sinking. Grazing ‘pushes’ the community towards larger cell sizes, whereas nutrient uptake and sinking ‘pull’ the community towards smaller cell sizes. We find that the stable environmental conditions of the tropics strongly balance these forces leading to persistently small cell sizes and reduced size diversity. In contrast, the seasonality of the temperate region causes the community to regularly reorganize via shifts in species composition and to exhibit, on average, bigger cell sizes and higher size diversity than in the tropics. Our results raise the importance of environmental variability as a key structuring mechanism of plankton communities in the ocean and call for a reassessment of the current understanding of phytoplankton diversity patterns across latitudinal gradients.},

But these variations are not well documented as synoptic taxonomic data are difficult to acquire. Here, we examine how phytoplankton assemblage and diversity vary between mesoscale eddies and submesoscale fronts. We use a multi-phytoplankton numerical model embedded in a mesoscale flow representative of the North Atlantic. Our model results suggest that the mesoscale flow dynamically distorts the niches predefined by environmental contrasts at the basin scale and that the phytoplankton diversity landscape varies over temporal and spatial scales that are one order of magnitude smaller than those of the basin-scale environmental conditions. We find that any assemblage and any level of diversity can occur in eddies and fronts. However, on a statistical level, the results suggest a tendency for larger diversity and more fast-growing types at fronts, where nutrient supplies are larger and where populations of adjacent water masses are constantly brought into contact; and lower diversity in the core of eddies, where water masses are kept isolated long enough to enable competitive exclusion.},

	abstract = {Background: Despite enormous environmental variability linked to glacial/interglacial climates of the Pleistocene, we have recently shown that marine diatom communities evolved slowly through gradual changes over the past 1.5 million years. Identifying the causes of this ecological stability is key for understanding the mechanisms that control the tempo and mode of community evolution.
Methodology/Principal Findings: If community assembly were controlled by local environmental selection rather than dispersal, environmental perturbations would change community composition, yet, this could revert once environmental conditions returned to previous-like states. We analyzed phytoplankton community composition across .104 km latitudinal transects in the Atlantic Ocean and show that local environmental selection of broadly dispersed species primarily controls community structure. Consistent with these results, three independent fossil records of marine diatoms over the past 250,000 years show cycles of community departure and recovery tightly synchronized with the temporal variations in Earth’s climate.
Conclusions/Significance: Changes in habitat conditions dramatically alter community structure, yet, we conclude that the high dispersal of marine planktonic microbes erases the legacy of past environmental conditions, thereby decreasing the tempo of community evolution.},

	abstract = {Significance
            Most ecosystem models used to predict changes in community composition with climate change assume species’ responses to environmental conditions are genetically fixed on the century scale, but this hypothesis has not been tested. Using an oceanographic time series with directional environmental changes, we show here that many phytoplankton species are able to track, on average, modest changes in temperature and irradiance, but not decreases in limiting nutrient concentrations, on decadal timescales. This result suggests that models that use genetically fixed traits may not provide reasonable projections for changes in biological communities in response to climate change over decadal to longer timescales.
          , 
            Model projections indicate that climate change may dramatically restructure phytoplankton communities, with cascading consequences for marine food webs. It is currently not known whether evolutionary change is likely to be able to keep pace with the rate of climate change. For simplicity, and in the absence of evidence to the contrary, most model projections assume species have fixed environmental preferences and will not adapt to changing environmental conditions on the century scale. Using 15 y of observations from Station CARIACO (Carbon Retention in a Colored Ocean), we show that most of the dominant species from a marine phytoplankton community were able to adapt their realized niches to track average increases in water temperature and irradiance, but the majority of species exhibited a fixed niche for nitrate. We do not know the extent of this adaptive capacity, so we cannot conclude that phytoplankton will be able to adapt to the changes anticipated over the next century, but community ecosystem models can no longer assume that phytoplankton cannot adapt.},

A principal component analysis of the environmental response profiles clearly distinguishes the responses of diatoms and dinoflagellates to environmental forcing. Phytoplankton abundance primarily varied with temperature, pH, and irradiance, with salinity and macronutrient concentrations acting as secondary drivers.

Microscopy results from the upper 55 m indicated that the abundance of microphytoplankton ( 420 mm) decreased by more than 5-fold from 1996 through 2010, accompanied by a change in diatom composition and a 4-fold reduction in large diatom cell numbers, particularly during upwelling periods. HPLC results also indicate a decline in diatoms, but not nearly to the same extent. Rather, HPLC data suggests a substantial reorganization of the phytoplankton community. Between the two time periods, there was a signiﬁcant deepening of high biomass concentrations from near surface waters to depths below 55 m. At the same time, phytoplankton diversity increased by 14\%, while seasonal variability in community composition declined. Vertical photopigment distributions of nanophytoplankton ( o20 mm) further showed signiﬁcant overall increases in coccolithophore, cryptophyte, and other phytoﬂagellate concentrations. The deepening in phytoplankton biomass below the mixed layer, the relative increase in smaller taxa, and the increasing homogeneity in phytoplankton distributions over time are likely a direct response to a reduction in upwelling intensity and a deepening of the euphotic zone associated with a decrease in the average trade winds of the region from 2006–2010, compared to 1996–2000. Surprisingly, the overall decline in large cells dominated by diatoms and an increase in smaller taxa has led to no signiﬁcant change in the export of particulate organic carbon (POC) to depth, contrary to many studies that predict increasing stratiﬁcation with future climate change scenarios will reduce POC export and carbon sequestration in the deep ocean.},

In recent years, multiple occurrences of abnormal algal prolifer­ ation in water conveyance channels have posed potential risks to the water quality of diverted water. To clarify the growth situation of phytoplankton and evaluate the response relationships between water environmental parameters and phytoplankton in the MRP, in this study, a long-term monitoring dataset was collected from seven monitoring sites from May 2015 to December 2020 to statistically analyse the spatiotemporal character­ istics of planktonic algal cell density (ACD). Based on this, four machine learning models, including multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector regression (SVR), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XBGoost), were constructed to predict the ACD, and the SHapely Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was used to interpret the best prediction model for identifying the response relationship between water environ­ mental parameters and ACD. The results showed that (1) the seven monitoring sites could be divided into two significant groups (i.e., Group I and Group II) by hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA), among which the ACD of Group II was higher than that of Group I. (2) the performance of four prediction models using different evalu­ ation metrics indicated that the RF model surpassed in prediction accuracy compared with the other three models in predicting ACD variations in Group I and Group II. (3) SHAP analysis revealed that the key factors affecting ACD variations in Group I were water temperature (WT), water depth (WD), permanganate index (PI), flow rate (Q) and dissolved oxygen (DO), and the ACD were inhibited when WT was below 23 ◦C, WD exceeded 6.5 m, and Q was between 100 and 250 m3/s. Additionally, WT, PI, and DO were the most important predictors of ACD in Group II, and ACD were inhibited when WT was below 24 ◦C, PI was lower than 2.4 mg/L and DO was higher than 9 mg/L. This research provides a theoretical basis and reference for water quality management and algal ecological control of water transfer projects with high spatial heterogeneity.},

These data were combined with a time series of Seaviewing Wide-Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), advanced very high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR), and European Remote Sensing Satellite/QuikScat data to examine the spatial extent of a cold coastal upwelling plume and a phytoplankton bloom associated with it. The seasonal upwelling cycle was directly linked to the intensity of the Trade Winds, with sea-surface temperature (SST) changes lagging the wind by 1–2 weeks. The seasonal cycle of most properties was punctuated by transient phenomena, some of which caused subsurface ventilation and also high primary production events. Integrated primary production ranged from 650, 574, and 593 g C mÀ2 yrÀ1 in 1996, 1997, and 2001, respectively, to 372, 484, and 448 g C mÀ2 yrÀ1, respectively, in 1998, 1999, and 2000. The Rutgers vertical generalized production model (VGPM) was modiﬁed to reﬂect an increase in Assimilation Number (PBopt) with SST at the Cariaco time series station, because the original VGPM formulation suggested inhibition of primary production at SST4211C. Trap observations showed that between 9 and 10 g C mÀ2 yrÀ1 were delivered to the bottom at the Cariaco time series station, i.e. \$1.33\% of surface primary productivity. Annual particulate organic carbon ﬂux to the bottom over the area of the Cariaco Basin (waters 4100 m), estimated using SeaWiFS and AVHRR variable inputs and the updated VGPM, ranged from 6.77 Â 1010 to 7.61 Â 1010 g C.

These variables are necessary for understanding and predicting ocean productivity, carbon ﬂuxes, underwater light propagation, water quality, and for assessing marine photochemical processes. The Cariaco Basin, located on the continental shelf of Venezuela in the southeastern Caribbean Sea, is the site of the CARIACO Ocean Time-Series project. Since 1995, CARIACO has collected bio-optical (hyperspectral inherent and apparent optical properties — IOPs and AOPs, respectively), biogeochemical and ecological observations to characterize local ecosystem variations in response to regional and global changes in climate. We examine phytoplankton taxonomic and pigment time series data collected by this program between 2006 and 2012 to understand how seasonal changes in these parameters relate to biooptical data (i.e., absorption spectra). TChla and accessory pigments varied seasonally in response to changes in the phytoplankton community composition, with higher concentrations of microphytoplankton (N 20 μm; 45\%) during upwelling (December–April) than during the rainy season (16\%; May/June–October/November). Picophytoplankton (b 2 μm) dominated during the rainy season (66\%). The absorption properties also exhibited seasonal variations. Diagnostic pigments could not be identiﬁed in a quantitative way using derivative analysis of phytoplankton absorption, likely because of overlapping of absorption spectra among the pigments present. The POC:TChla ratio at CARIACO was variable and dependent on bulk carbon (not necessarily related to phytoplankton) and the functional groups present at any given time, underscoring the fact that using a ﬁxed ratio of POC:Chla in biogeochemical models can lead to large uncertainties in carbon budgets from coastal zones. Low POC:TChla was associated with microphytoplankton size class (diatoms), while picophytoplankton (cyanobacteria) exhibited higher ratios. These results contribute to furthering our understanding of coastal phytoplankton dynamics and how they relate to optical signatures.},

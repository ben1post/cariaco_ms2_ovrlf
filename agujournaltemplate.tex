\begin{keypoints}
\item The phytoplankton community data identified by microscopy from the CARIACO Time Series between 1996 and 2016 shows two separate clusters characterized by high and low upwelling regimes respectively.
\item Despite the differing physical regimes and large shifts between functional groups, there is no significant difference in diversity metrics between the two clusters. Overall, diversity (i.e. Genus Richness) shows a positive linear relationship to Biomass, Productivity as well as Resource Use Efficiency.
\item A gradient forest analysis of the community data reveals that the strongest predictor of shifts within the community is the AMO index with a time lag of 5 months, which points to a strong impact of large scale climatic oscillations in the tropical coastal ecosystem. The next strongest predictor is nitrate concentration, with the MEI v2 index (lag of 4 months) and salinity following behind.

        % below is from 2019 REVIEW
        Hydrographic observations (Figure 2) show strong seasonality and interannual variability in the upper 400 m in the Cariaco Basin. This is controlled by seasonal and interannual changes in the wind and in the intensity of the geostrophic Caribbean Current (Muller-Karger et al. 1989). Primary upwelling was strongest between November and May. In general, during upwelling, sea surface temperatures ranged between approximately 23◦Cand25◦C. The secondary upwelling that occurs between June and August is shorter (∼5 weeks) and is approximately 1.5\°C warmer than the primary upwelling. It is driven by Ekman transport and an intensification of the curl of the wind close to the southern coast of the Caribbean (Rueda-Roa \& Muller-Karger 2013, Rueda-Roa et al. 2018). Upwelled waters move offshore in plumes that extended as far as 50 km to more than 250 km from the coast (Muller-Karger et al. 1989, 2010). From July to October, there is strong stratification in the upper 50 m of the water column after the wind weakens and the rain and rivers deliver less saline waters (Figure 2).
        Sea surface temperatures ranged from approximately 28◦C to 30◦C during the period of stratification (Figure 2). The mixed-layer depth varied from less than 10 m to 35 m during the 21-year time series (Figure 3). Satellite sea surface temperature and ocean color observations show that upwelling pulsates throughout the year at the scale of days to weeks, leading to marked variation in primary production (Figure 3). CARIACO rigorously characterized the annual seasonal variation in primary productivity and stratification. The length of the time series was key in capturing interannual variations that spanned decades. Satellite sea surface temperature and field data show that upwelling was stronger between 1996 and 2002. After 2002, trade wind intensity became weaker (Taylor et al. 2012).
        The field observations, particularly those in the upper 50 m, showed what appeared to be a return to stronger upwelling conditions starting in 2014 (Figure 2a).

        
        \item "Here's where we come in..." Talk about how most of the analysis stopped after 2012, time series died out, but there is more data there and particularly looking at community data, we can see a return.

\section{Materials and Methods}
% Here is text on Materials and Methods.
%
\subsection{Study Site}
  %Talk about the Basin shortly, then about the time series
    The Cariaco Ocean Time-Series Program was established to investigate the link between ocean surface processes and the sinking flux of particulate carbon. The Cariaco Basin is a large ($\sim$ 160 km long, 70 km wide) and deep ($\sim$ 1,400 m) basin, located on the north-eastern Venezuelan continental shelf, bound to the north by a sill at a mean depth of about 100 m. It is a relatively productive area ($\sim$ 400 $g C m^{-2} y^{-1}$), with primary production and vertical particulate organic matter fluxes that are higher than BATS and HOT locations, leading to the accumulation of anoxic bottom waters below 200 m depth.

    \subsubsection{In-Situ Data}
    Samples were collected as part of the Cariaco Ocean Time-Series Program in monthly research vessel cruises to a station located in the eastern Cariaco Basin (10.50° N, 64.67° W). % https://imars.usf.edu/?page_id=1027 (10°30’N, 64°40’W) ???

    % from 2019 Review:
    The CARIACO field program consisted of a monthly core oceanographic cruise, two sediment trap deployment/recovery cruises per year, and two microbiogeochemical cruises targeting microbial processes across the oxic–anoxic interface per year. Field logistics and partial sample analysis were coordinated by the Fundación La Salle de Ciencias Naturales on Margarita Island, Venezuela. Details of the history of sampling procedures in CARIACO as well as sampling schemes, analytical methods, and data quality control and intercalibration procedures have been described by \citeA{mullerkarger_annual_2001, thunell_particulate_2007, astor_yrene_m_handbook_2013, astor_interannual_2013, astor_sintesis_2014}.
    
    % below paragraph is from Taylor et al. 2012
    % I should similarly reference the other more comprehensive data protocols like they do
    % but also explain the methodology quickly, like they did
    Sampling and processing protocols for hydrography, NPP, Chla, phaeo, nutrient concentrations, and sediment trap deployment and processing appear in Muller-Karger et al. (8). These data are available from www.imars. usf.edu/CAR, the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) (www.nodc. noaa.gov), and the Biological and Chemical Oceanography Data Management Office (BCO-DMO) (http://bco-dmo.org/data). From late 1995 to early 1998, nutrient data were provided by William Senior (Universidad de Oriente, Cumana, Venezuela) and by Dr. K. Fanning (University of South Florida, St. Petersburg, FL) from mid-1997 to the present. Samples from eight cruises were analyzed by both laboratories; PO43− and Si[OH]4 data agreed very well ($±$5\%), but NOx and NH4+ did not. Therefore, the entire PO43− and Si[OH]4 dataset and only the USF NOx and NH4+ dataset were used here.

    Phytoplankton enumeration was conducted on water samples (500 mL) collected by Niskin bottles at depths of 1, 7, 15, 25, 35, 55 m and fixed with 5\% sodium tetraborate-buffered formaldehyde (final concentration). Quantitative analyses were performed using settling chambers and an inverted microscope according the Utermöhl method (38).
    
    % The below is from Pinckney et al. 2015
    % They have more detail about Phytoplankton, either use this, or reference them
    Samples were collected as part of the Cariaco Ocean Time-Series Program at a station located in the eastern Cariaco Basin (101300N and 641400W) between November 1995 and January 2017. All samples were collected using a 12 bottle rosette system equipped with a CTD (SeaBird, model SBE 25) (Astor and Varela, 2013). Water samples for chl a and phaeopigment analysis were obtained on a monthly basis from the first cast of each of cruise. Samples were collected at 8 standard depths in the upper 100 m (1, 7, 15, 25, 35, 55, 75, and 100 m) following Varela (2013). For phytoplankton species determination by microscopy, 500 ml of seawater were collected at the same depths into HDPE bottles and fixed with a 4\% formalin solution neutralized with sodium tetraborate. Samples were analyzed at the Universidad de Oriente, Venezuela, using the Utermöhl technique (Hasle, 1978) with 100 ml sedimentation chambers and a settling period of 48 h. Identifications and enumerations by microscopy were limited to microphytoplankton (cells $>$20 mm) (Mutshinda et al., 2013).
    
    % The below is from Taylor et al. 2012 again
    % I can use as template to introduce ERA5, MEIv2 etc.
    To gauge ITCZ changes relevant to Cariaco Basin data, we developed ITCZ indices over South America (20°S to 5°N and 290°W to 320°W) and the Tropical Atlantic (15°S to 20°N and 300°W to 357.5°W) as area-weighted precipitation and convergence, using the precipitation intensity and negative divergence of horizontal winds, respectively. We calculate ITCZ indices using the previously described center of action (COA) approach (39). The NCEP Reanalysis (40) was the source of data for NAO (www.cgd.ucar.edu/cas/ jhurrell/ indices.html), Azores High, and ITCZ analyses. Precipitation intensities were obtained from Global Precipitation Climatology Project (41). In all cases except the NAO, derived data were obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research/Earth System Research Laboratory Physical Sciences Division (NOAA/ OAR/ESRL PSD) (www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd). 

    \subsubsection{Climate data}
    %from Taylor et al. 2012
    Zonal wind stress (−u, easterly Trade Winds) across the southern Caribbean Sea drives near-shore upwelling of nutrient-rich waters by Ekman transport. We extracted the -u wind component at 10 m from the ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) climate model and data reanalysis at the grid cell closest to the Cariaco Time Series sampling coordinates (10.5°N,64.8°W ?double check?), obtained from \url{https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-era5-single-levels} (accessed June 2024)
    
    The monthly AMO index data (10 year lowpass), defined as an area average of detrended low-pass filtered North Atlantic SST anomalies, were obtained from \url{https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data/atlantic-multi-decadal-oscillation-amo} (accessed in June, 2024).
    
    The bi-monthly multivariate El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) indices (MEI v.2), defined as the time series of the leading combined Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) of five different variables (sea level pressure (SLP), sea surface temperature (SST), zonal and meridional components of the surface wind, and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR)) over the tropical Pacific basin (30°S-30°N and 100°E-70°W) were obtained from \url{https://psl.noaa.gov/enso/mei/} (accessed in June, 2024). In our analysis, bi-monthly values are aligned with the tail month (December-January is treated as the value for January).
    

    \subsubsection{Data processing}
    % Niskin, CTD and Phytoplankton data processing
    - quality control, removed outliers, interpolation, averaging
    All done in R

    
    \subsection{Data analysis}
    
    \subsubsection{Z-Scores}
    % from Fraker et al. 2022 - Lake Erie paper
    To visualize how ecosystem components changed through time and to identify similarities in temporal trends among variables, each standardized data point (i.e., annual value) was color-coded based on whether its standardized score was greater or less than the long-term mean (negative anomaly: red; positive anomaly: blue; deeper shades indicating greater values). The variables were then ordered based on their loading onto PCA axis 1 (R package ‘ade4’; Dray and Dufour, 2007; R version 3.6.3; RCoreTeam, 2020) to indicate their degree of change over the time interval and their similarity with one another. Such visualizations have been shown to provide a useful portrayal of ecosystem change (e.g., Choi et al., 2005; Vasilakopoulos et al., 2017; Harvey et al., 2020).
    

    \subsubsection{BDEF and Diversity}
    % from Ptacnik et al. 2008
    Diversity was defined as the number of genera present in a given sample. Reducing the taxonomic resolution to genus level made the dataset more homogeneous and more robust to differences in skill and effort among the individual phytoplankton analysts. 


    % Regression analysis of RUE
    To analyze the variability of phytoplankton diversity across temporal and depth ranges, we interpolated the discrete depth counts and divided the resulting depth profile by 4 equal depth intervals (0-25, 25-50, 50-75 and 75-100 m). 
    
    RUE: We excluded observations with TP concentrations 2 gliter1 (n  15) because they are close to the detection limit, resulting in very imprecise measurements.
    Phytoplankton biomass divided by the limiting resource (total phosphorus) gave the yield or resource use efficiency (RUE) for the community. We estimated RUE both in terms of chlorophyll-a (RUEchl = chlorophyll-a:TP) and carbon biomass (RUEcarb  PPC:TP)

    
        
    \subsubsection{Clustering and NMDS}
    % from Winder and Hunter 2008
    Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination and hierarchical clustering analysis were used to extract gradients in phytoplankton community composition over time based on the Sørenson (Bray–Curtis) distance matrix. NMDS is a powerful tool for ecological community data that include a large portion of zero values because it is not biased by the ‘‘joint absences’’ effect (McCune et al. 2002) and outperformed linear models (such as principal components analysis or redundancy analysis). NMDS is an iterative search for the positions of species and time on few dimensions (axes) that minimizes the departure from monotonicity in the association between distance (dissimilarity) in the original data and ordination space. It plots dissimilar objects far apart in the ordination space and similar objects close to one another. The temporal dynamics of the phytoplankton community was characterized based on biovolume averages to reflect the true contribution of individual species to phytoplankton community composition (Interlandi and Kilham 2001). Temporal change of phytoplankton genera is conducted on a matrix of annual averages (year) by genera biovolume to extract years with similar phytoplankton structure. Data were transformed by square root transformation and double standardized (species by maximum species biovolume and dates to unit totals). NMDS is started from random starting configurations and the solution with the lowest ‘‘stress’’ was selected from 500 runs. Stress measures departure of fit between the ordination and the data and is calculated as a departure from monotonicity between the two series of distances. A stable three-dimensional solution was identified for all ordinations. Orthogonal rotation of the NMDS solution was used to maximize correlations of axes so that the variance of points is maximized on first dimension. Environmental variables were related to the strongest gradients (axes) in species composition and, using overlays, in the ordination space towards which the environmental vectors change most rapidly and to which they have maximal correlations with the ordination configuration. Linear regression was used to relate the environmental data of nutrient concentration, optical and physical (mixing) properties, as well as zooplankton (crustacean) density to the NMDS axis scores (Jovan and McCune 2005). Multivariate analysis was conducted using the vegan package in R.
    % could add indicator species per cluster, as they have done
        
    \subsubsection{Gradient Forest}
    % from Fraker et al. 2022 - Lake Erie paper
    gradient forest analysis was used to identify and compare among the drivers that predicted the temporal trends within each of the indicator datasets and time intervals examined. Gradient forest analysis is a community-level extension of random forest analysis that aggregates regression trees to quantify turnover in indicator variables across driver (or pressure) variables (Pitcher et al., 2012; Large et al., 2015; Tam et al., 2017). It partitions a goodness-of-fit statistic among each driver variable for each indicator variable, then averages over indicators to produce an overall importance for that driver (R2P). The split values of the regression trees also identify thresholds for the driver variables at which the chosen indicator variables exhibit large changes in value (e.g., community turnover in the fish, bird, and zooplankton abundance indicator datasets). Plots of the cumulative predictive importance of each driver variable can suggest target values for management of key drivers of ecosystem condition (i.e., where thresholds occur; Tam et al., 2017). These analyses were conducted for abundances of each taxa and the fish-derived ecosystem indicators within each time interval (the long, intermediate, and short-term intervals, as well as each 20-year interval), except for zooplankton during the 1969–2018, 1969–1988, and 1979–1998 intervals due to lack of monitoring data during these times. These analyses were conducted using R package ‘gradientforest’ with 500 trees, a maximum of three splits, and correlation threshold of 0.5; \cite{ellis_gradient_2012}.

\caption{Interestingly only time lags of the climatic indices (AMO and MEIv2) actually showed better predictive capabilities, there were none for lags of wind, nutrients or the isotherm. What I also included in the plot above is the underlying mechanism of fitting a random forest model for each genus. The plot on the top right shows the weighted importance for each genus, ranked according to the predictive capability of the model, and color coded by their respective group. Similarly, the cumulative importance plots below show the overall importance, as well as the individual color lines that show the cumulative importance per genus predicted. This is not necessarily useful to show in the final manuscript, unless we want to discuss the model output down to the genus level. Not surprisingly, it is mostly diatoms that are predictable, but also other groups are present here.}

\section{Discussion}
This present study demonstrates the highly dynamic nature of a tropical coastal marine ecosystem, that is driven by local environmental variability, which is in turn affected by large scale climatic shifts. In the Cariaco basin, long-term climatic oscillations have affected the upwelling regime and ...
In the Cariaco basin, wind-driven seasonal upwelling dictates the nutrient availability in the upper mixed layer, which in turn affects the phytoplankton dynamics \cite{ptacnik_diversity_2008, bopp_response_2005}. In particular, Diatoms are responsive to changes in the mixing regime \cite{huisman_reduced_2006}.
Alterations in physical mixing affected phytoplankton dynamics,

The Caribbean experiences the most marked of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation teleconnections in the Atlantic Ocean, with warmer sea surface temperatures and trade winds blowing more to the north-northwest during the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (Enfield & Mayer 1997).

\section*{Open Research Section}
This section MUST contain a statement that describes where the data supporting the conclusions can be obtained. Data cannot be listed as ''Available from authors'' or stored solely in supporting information. Citations to archived data should be included in your reference list. Wiley will publish it as a separate section on the paper’s page. Examples and complete information are here:

\section*{As Applicable – Inclusion in Global Research Statement}
The Authorship: Inclusion in Global Research policy aims to promote greater equity and transparency in research collaborations. AGU Publications encourage research collaborations between regions, countries, and communities and expect authors to include their local collaborators as co-authors when they meet the AGU Publications authorship criteria (described here: https://www.agu.org/publications/authors/policies\#authorship). Those who do not meet the criteria should be included in the Acknowledgement section. We encourage researchers to consider recommendations from The TRUST CODE - A Global Code of Conduct for Equitable Research Partnerships (https://www.globalcodeofconduct.org/) when conducting and reporting their research, as applicable, and encourage authors to include a disclosure statement pertaining to the ethical and scientific considerations of their research collaborations in an “Inclusion in Global Research Statement’ as a standalone section in the manuscript following the Conclusions section. This can include disclosure of permits, authorizations, permissions and/or any formal agreements with local communities or other authorities, additional acknowledgements of local help received, and/or description of end-users of the research. You can learn more about the policy in this editorial. Example statements can be found in the following published papers: 
%Holt et al. (https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022JG007188), 
%Sánchez-Gutiérrez et al. (https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2023JG007554), 
%Tully et al. (https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1029/2022JG007128) 
%Please note that these statements are titled as “Global Research Collaboration Statements” from a previous pilot requirement in JGR Biogeosciences. The pilot has ended and statements should now be titled “Inclusion in Global Research Statement”.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Capitalize the first letter of each word (except for

% AGU follows standard outline style; therefore, there cannot be a section 1 without
% a section 2, or a section 2.3.1 without a section 2.3.2.
% Please make sure your section numbers are balanced.
% ---------------
% Level 1 head

%
%  EQUATIONS
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Single-line equations are centered.
% Equation arrays will appear left-aligned.

Math coded inside display math mode \[ ...\]
 will not be numbered, e.g.,:
 \[ x^2=y^2 + z^2\]

 Math coded inside \begin{equation} and \end{equation} will
 be automatically numbered, e.g.,:
 \begin{equation}
 x^2=y^2 + z^2
 \end{equation}


% To create multiline equations, use the
% \begin{eqnarray} and \end{eqnarray} environment
% as demonstrated below.
\begin{eqnarray}
  x_{1} & = & (x - x_{0}) \cos \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \sin \Theta  \nonumber \\
  y_{1} & = & -(x - x_{0}) \sin \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \cos \Theta.
\end{eqnarray}

%If you don't want an equation number, use the star form:
%\begin{eqnarray*}...\end{eqnarray*}

% Break each line at a sign of operation
% (+, -, etc.) if possible, with the sign of operation
% on the new line.

% Indent second and subsequent lines to align with
% the first character following the equal sign on the
% first line.

% Use an \hspace{} command to insert horizontal space
% into your equation if necessary. Place an appropriate
% unit of measure between the curly braces, e.g.
% \hspace{1in}; you may have to experiment to achieve
% the correct amount of space.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%  EQUATION NUMBERING: COUNTER
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% You may change equation numbering by resetting
% the equation counter or by explicitly numbering
% an equation.

% To explicitly number an equation, type \eqnum{}
% (with the desired number between the brackets)
% after the \begin{equation} or \begin{eqnarray}
% command.  The \eqnum{} command will affect only
% the equation it appears with; LaTeX will number
% any equations appearing later in the manuscript
% according to the equation counter.
%

% If you have a multiline equation that needs only
% one equation number, use a \nonumber command in
% front of the double backslashes (\\) as shown in
% the multiline equation above.

% If you are using line numbers, remember to surround
% equations with \begin{linenomath*}...\end{linenomath*}

%  To add line numbers to lines in equations:
%  \begin{linenomath*}
%  \begin{equation}
%  \end{equation}
%  \end{linenomath*}

\begin{generalcomment}
	This manuscript has been examined by two expert reviewers. Overall, both are supportive of this work, but highlight some important concerns related to lower resolution of observations toward the end of the time-series, leading to possible seasonal biases. The impact of this possible bias on the conclusions is unclear. I urge the authors to pursue the recommendations from the reviewers in order to fortify their analyses.
\end{generalcomment}
\begin{revresponse}[We appreciate your handling of the review process.]

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item We added an in-depth discussion of the impact of missing data, particularly towards the end of the time series.
		\item We corrected spelling errors etc...
        %NOTE: can add this at the very end, when we decided what stays in.

\begin{generalcomment}
	This manuscript examines climatic, physical and biogeochemical drivers controlling multi-year variability of phytoplankton community composition in the Cariaco Basin, Venezuela, using a diverse set of environmental predictors including climate indices like the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and the El Niño Southern Oscillation (MEI v.2), atmospheric layers like wind speed, precipitation and evaporation from a reanalysis model, and concurrent in situ properties collected from CTD casts including seawater temperature, salinity, and dissolved inorganic nutrients. These observations are paired with monthly chlorophyll-a and micro-phytoplankton cell counts performed with microscopy collected from Niskin samples at multiple depths within the upper 100 m of the water column by the CARIACO Ocean Time Series project between 1996 and 2016. The authors compute yearly anomalies in predictor observations and phytoplankton densities using normalized "z" scores to identify trends in physical and biogeochemical parameters and detect shifts in community composition as well as in diversity metrics (i.e. species richness, Shannon index, Pielou's eveness) of primary producers. These analyses are further assisted by multi-dimensional ordination techniques. The authors apply a random forest model with gradient analysis to evaluate correlations between predictor metrics and phytoplankton assemblages and quantify the relative importance of each environmental parameter in shaping species composition of primary producers in the Cariaco Basin. The authors find a strong inverse correlation between AMO and wind speed, and phytoplankton counts, especially diatoms and haptophytes, attributed to changes in Ekman upwelling and associated nutrient supply to the euphotic zone. Clear seasonal and interannual trends in species richness emerged from the 20-year times series but not for all other diversity indices.
\end{generalcomment}

\begin{generalcomment} (continued) 
Results show a drastic shift in the phytoplankton community in 2004 coinciding with an AMO sign shift that lasted through 2013, followed by an assemblage recovery in 2014-2016 when the AMO sign returned to negative values. Gradient forest analysis indicated that AMO has the strongest effect on Cariaco's phytoplankton community structure followed by SST, MEI v.2, and nitrate concentration. The goals of the study are clear, the methodological approach is sound, and data analyses are novel and interesting, and results contribute valuable insights into bottom-up controls on primary producers in the Cariaco Basin that can in turn help to better resolve the rich paleo-climate record preserved in the basin's sediments. The manuscript is well written and concise.

\begin{revcomment}
	The Cariaco Basin is subject to a secondary upwelling pulse that typically occurs between June and August every year. This event is mainly controlled by the intensification of wind curl and transport of the Caribbean current, and not by ITCZ dynamics. While this upwelling event is somewhat weaker than the primary upwelling during January-April it can lead to significant shoaling of the nutricline and associated increase in primary productivity, chl-a concentration, and diatom abundance. This secondary upwelling pulse likely adds nuance to the seasonality of the phytoplankton community that cannot be captured with annually averaged data due to signal smoothing and attenuation. Therefore, there could value in performing analyses with seasonally aggregated data to determine whether the phytoplankton response to the AMO shift is dominated solely by changes in primary upwelling or if this effect also becomes apparent as changes in the strength of the secondary upwelling. Seasonal data analysis could aid in 1) quantifying the impact of shifts in AMO and MEI v.2 on this secondary welling pulse, 2) identifying additional community clusters and their association to a particular index, and 3) disentangling physical drivers of species turnover (as shown in Figure 4) during primary and secondary upwelling events.
\end{revcomment}
\begin{revresponse}
	We thank the reviewer for this insightful suggestion. We agree that the secondary upwelling (June-August) represents a distinct oceanographic event with potentially different drivers than the primary upwelling (December-May). To address this, we conducted additional analyses stratifying the data by three seasons: primary upwelling, secondary upwelling, and rainy season (September-November).
    
    \textit{Seasonal gradient forest analysis}
    
    We ran gradient forest models separately for each season (primary upwelling $n=104$, secondary upwelling $n=47$, rainy season $n=42$). Given modest sample sizes for the latter two seasons, we interpret these results as exploratory.
    
    Key findings:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item AMO ranked as the top predictor across all three seasons with optimized time lags. Notably, AMO emerged as the strongest predictor for secondary upwelling even without any time lag, indicating a strong linkage to community composition during this period. The optimal lag was shorter for secondary upwelling (2 months) than for primary upwelling (3 months), potentially suggesting a more immediate link between AMO and community response during secondary upwelling, although this one-month difference is marginal in the context of a multi-decadal time series.
        \item MEI v.2 ranked second for both primary and secondary upwelling, suggesting ENSO teleconnections influence both upwelling events.
        \item Silicate and total precipitation emerged among the top predictors during secondary upwelling. Given that precipitation peaks during June-August (visible in seasonal density distributions), elevated silicate likely reflects enhanced surface runoff during this period rather than upwelling-driven nutrient supply.
        \item The composition of predictable genera varied by season: primary upwelling models predicted predominantly diatoms alongside dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria; secondary upwelling and rainy season models predicted mostly diatoms and dinoflagellates, with dinoflagellates particularly prominent during the rainy season.
    \end{itemize}
    
    These results suggest that while AMO remains the dominant driver year-round, secondary upwelling exhibits distinct predictor signatures consistent with runoff influence rather than wind-driven nutrient supply.
    
    \textit{Community clustering by season}
    
    To assess whether seasonal variation produces distinct community states, we examined NMDS ordination colored by season and performed permutational ANOVA (Adonis) with temporal cluster and season as factors.
    
    Results:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Temporal cluster (interannual, AMO-related): $R^2 = 15.9\%$, $p = 0.001$
        \item Season: $R^2 = 3.7\%$, $p = 0.001$
    \end{itemize}
    
    While seasonality explains statistically significant variance, its effect size is approximately four times smaller than the interannual signal from our identified clusters. The NMDS ordination does not reveal a distinct community state associated with secondary upwelling (Figure~SX, Table~SX). This suggests that annually aggregated analysis captures the dominant mode of community variability.
    
    \textit{Limitations}
    
    We lack direct observations of ITCZ position and Caribbean current transport. Our wind speed data (ERA5 u10) does not capture wind curl. Future work incorporating these variables could further elucidate the distinct forcing of secondary upwelling.
    
    \textit{Conclusion}
    
    Our seasonal analyses confirm that AMO is the strongest predictor during both upwelling events, secondary upwelling shows distinct predictor signatures (silicate, precipitation) consistent with runoff influence, and the seasonal signal in community composition is substantially weaker than the interannual signal. These findings reinforce our main conclusion that decadal-scale AMO variability is the dominant driver of phytoplankton community shifts, while adding nuance regarding seasonal expression of this influence.

\begin{revcomment}
Trichodesmium and other cyanobacteria likely have a seasonal signal in the Basin with higher values in the non-upwelling period, which is characterized by strong stratification of the water column, lower nutrient and chl-a concentrations, and conditions that are generally favorable to nitrogen fixers. Higher abundances of Trichodesmium and Synechococcus during the "cluster 2" period, or years with positive AMO, weaker nutrient supply and stronger stratification, can be expected and especially if data are aggregated by season. It may be worth exploring this hypothesis.
\end{revcomment}
\begin{revresponse}
	We thank the reviewer for this insightful suggestion regarding cyanobacteria dynamics. We tested the hypothesis that cyanobacteria abundances, particularly \textit{Trichodesmium} and \textit{Synechococcus}, would be higher during stratified conditions (Cluster~2, positive AMO) by examining genus-level patterns.

    At the aggregate level, cyanobacteria cell counts from microscopy were significantly higher in Cluster~1 than in Cluster~2 across all seasons (Wilcoxon tests: Upwelling $p < 0.001$, Secondary Upwelling $p < 0.001$, Rainy $p = 0.043$). However, genus-level analysis revealed contrasting patterns between the two dominant cyanobacteria taxa.

    \textit{Trichodesmium} showed no significant difference between clusters (Wilcoxon $p = 0.11$) but exhibited strong seasonal variation within both clusters (Kruskal-Wallis: Cluster~1 $\chi^2 = 14.7$, $p < 0.001$; Cluster~2 $\chi^2 = 22.8$, $p < 0.001$), with highest abundances during the secondary upwelling and rainy seasons. Correlations with stratification indicators supported the reviewer's hypothesis: \textit{Trichodesmium} was positively correlated with SST ($\rho = 0.48$, $p < 0.001$), 21\,°C isotherm depth ($\rho = 0.43$, $p < 0.001$), and AMO ($\rho = 0.24$, $p < 0.001$), and negatively correlated with nitrate concentration ($\rho = -0.39$, $p < 0.001$). These results are consistent with the ecology of \textit{Trichodesmium} as a nitrogen-fixer favored by warm, stratified, nutrient-depleted conditions.

    In contrast, \textit{Synechococcus} was detected exclusively during Cluster~1, with zero counts recorded throughout the entire Cluster~2 period (Wilcoxon $p < 0.001$). This pattern is opposite to ecological expectations, as \textit{Synechococcus} typically thrives under stratified, oligotrophic conditions. The absence of \textit{Synechococcus} detections in Cluster~2 likely reflects the methodological constraints of light microscopy rather than true absence. \textit{Synechococcus} cells are approximately 1\,\textmu m in diameter, well below the $\sim$20\,\textmu m detection limit of the Utermöhl method employed in this study. The detections recorded during Cluster~1 may represent larger colonial aggregates or cells associated with detrital particles that were visible during high-biomass conditions.

    These findings highlight the complementary value of flow cytometry or pigment-based approaches (e.g., zeaxanthin) for characterizing picoplanktonic cyanobacteria responses to stratification, which was beyond the scope of the present analysis focused on the microscopy cell count data. Nevertheless, the \textit{Trichodesmium} results provide partial support for the reviewer's hypothesis regarding nitrogen-fixer dynamics in the Cariaco Basin.

\begin{revcomment}
Monthly primary productivity rate (PP) measurements derived from 14C incubations were also performed throughout the duration of the CARIACO project. It may be worth examining climate indices and physical parameters as predictors of PP, and in turn relationships between PP and phytoplankton community clusters, possibly yielding interesting insights into the roles of different assemblages in PP variability and carbon sequestration.
\end{revcomment}
\begin{revresponse}
	We thank the reviewer for this thoughtful suggestion regarding primary productivity (PP) measurements. We investigated the relationship between PP and chlorophyll~\textit{a} concentration, finding a strong positive correlation (Spearman's $\rho = 0.70$, $p < 0.001$, $n = 202$; Pearson's $r = 0.74$ on log-transformed values). This indicates that chlorophyll~\textit{a} captures a substantial portion of PP variability ($R^2 = 0.55$).

    Examining PP correlations with the key predictors identified in our gradient forest analysis, we found that PP was significantly correlated with SST ($\rho = -0.60$), nitrate concentration ($\rho = 0.60$), and 21\,°C isotherm depth ($\rho = -0.55$), consistent with bottom-up control through the upwelling system. The correlation with AMO was weaker but significant ($\rho = -0.18$, $p < 0.01$), while MEI~v.2 showed no significant relationship with PP ($\rho = 0.04$, $p = 0.54$).

    Interestingly, when comparing PP between the two community clusters, we found no significant difference (Wilcoxon test, $W = 5487$, $p = 0.27$), despite chlorophyll~\textit{a} differing significantly between clusters ($p < 0.001$). This suggests that community-level productivity was maintained across the regime shift, possibly due to the compensatory contributions of smaller phytoplankton cells that were below the detection limit of light microscopy but captured by the \textsuperscript{14}C incubations. This observation is consistent with our interpretation of a shift toward smaller cell sizes during the low-upwelling period.

    However, the PP dataset contains substantial gaps, with 20\% of monthly observations missing overall and coverage declining markedly after 2009. Given the strong covariance between PP and chlorophyll~\textit{a}, the similar relationships with upwelling-related predictors, and the data coverage limitations, we believe chlorophyll~\textit{a} adequately represents productivity dynamics for the purposes of our community analysis.

\begin{revcomment}
Years in which shifts in environmental conditions and phytoplankton are observed mentioned throughput the text often don't match what is shown on figures. This is confusing and makes the reading and interpretation of results difficult. A few instances of where in the manuscript such mismatches occur are specified in the "Editorial comments" section below but please review this carefully.

Line 145: "This area is relatively productive ($\sim 400$ gCm$^{-2}$ y$^{-1}$)". How was this productivity estimated? If this is an average, add standard deviation value.
\end{revcomment}
\begin{revresponse}
	This value was chosen as a representative value based on reported values from literature, thank you for highlighting the missing reference and explanation.
    We have now calculated the average primary productivity across the entire time series using monthly interpolated values and added the exact mean value and standard deviation (\lineref{R1:C5:start}[R1:C5:end]):
    \begin{changes}
       This area is relatively productive (mean integrated primary production across the entire time series of $485 \pm 345$ g C m$^{-2}$ y$^{-1}$),...
    \end{changes}
    The calculation is based on the reported depth-discrete measurements of $^{14}$C-incubation based NPP with the units mg C m$^{-3}$ h$^{-1}$. These are depth integrated to 100 m, multiplied by 12 hours of daylight and 365 days in a year, and divided by 1000 to yield g C m$^{-2}$ y$^{-1}$. Mean and standard deviation were calculated with the depth-integrated values of all available monthly cruises.

Lines 203-205: Why was evaporation selected as a variable? How does evaporation control phytoplankton communities?
\end{revcomment}
\begin{revresponse}
	Evaporation was initially included as a proxy for heat flux, as it is driven by wind speed, sea surface temperature, and atmospheric humidity conditions. However, we agree with the reviewer that its inclusion is not well justified from a mechanistic perspective. Unlike precipitation, which has a direct influence on phytoplankton communities through its association with surface runoff, evaporation lacks a clear pathway of influence on community composition. Furthermore, its strong covariance with sea surface temperature and salinity means that any climate-related variance it might capture is already represented by these variables. We have therefore removed evaporation from the analysis. This modification did not qualitatively affect our results.

\begin{revresponse}
	This section of the Methods is only in reference to Figure 2 and the analysis of interannual variance using z-scores. For this specific analysis the years 1995, 2016, 2017 were excluded, for other parts of our analysis (where no annual averaging was performed) the monthly measurements from those years were included.
    
    We have added the following paragraph in \lineref{R1:C12:start}[R1:C12:end] to clarify this:
    \begin{changes}
        To provide an overview of the available data and highlight interannual trends and changes in the time series data, we calculated annual anomalies for relevant variables as normalized z scores, $z = \frac{(x – \mu)}{\sigma}$, where $x$ is the yearly mean, $\mu$ is the mean and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of all yearly means.  For the analysis of annual z-scores, we excluded years with fewer than six monthly observations. This applied to 1995 (n=2; November–December only), 2016 (n=5; January, February, May, September, December), and 2017 (n=1; January only). Climate and meteorological variables (AMO, MEI v.2, wind speed, precipitation) had complete monthly coverage from 1996–2016, while in-situ measurements showed occasional gaps throughout the time series, with sporadic missing months in 1997–2013 (typically 1–3 months per year) and more substantial gaps in 2014 (3 months missing: March, July, August) and 2015 (4 months missing: January, May, June, October). Importantly, despite these gaps, both 2014 and 2015 retained observations from both upwelling (December–May) and rainy (June–November) seasons, reducing the risk of seasonal bias in annual averages. 
    \end{changes}

\begin{revcomment}
Lines 327-329: Note that z scores for precipitation and salinity have an inverse relationship with silicates, indicating increased runoff.
\end{revcomment}
\begin{revresponse}
	We have added this information to the paragraph (see \lineref{R1:C14}):
    \begin{changes}
        Silicate anomalies, in contrast, did not follow the same pattern as nitrate and phosphate. Instead, annual anomalies show an inverse relationship with precipitation and salinity, indicating effects of surface runoff. Elevated concentrations were observed between 2008 and 2013, ...
    \end{changes}
\end{revresponse}

\begin{revcomment}
Lines 332-334: This should be reworded to specify that the persisting shift occurs for AMO and some physical parameters, and not in chl-a or cell counts for which the shift happens later, in 2005.
\end{revcomment}
\begin{revresponse}
	We reworded the paragraph (\lineref{R1:C15:start}[R1:C15:end]) to clarify this:
    \begin{changes}
        This biological shift was preceded by a change in the AMO index anomalies that occurred after 2002, when the index transitioned to a period of mostly positive anomalies that persisted until 2013. This period was also characterized by upwelling-related variables indicating a weak upwelling regime (low wind, high SST, deep isotherm). Thus, while the AMO and physical parameters shifted after 2002, the corresponding change in chlorophyll a and cell counts occurred later, after 2004.

    \begin{changes}
        Cumulative importance curves from gradient forest analysis show how the importance of a predictor accumulates across its range of values. The slope of the curve at any point indicates where the strongest compositional turnover occurs—steep sections represent threshold values where small changes in the predictor correspond to large changes in community composition, while flat sections indicate regions where the predictor has little influence on community structure. For the AMO index, we see a clear pattern in which negative anomalies affect the community (slope is highest for negative values).

Lines 569-572: Enhanced eddy activity near the Cariaco Basin during strong El Niño can stimulate productivity and lead to changes in community composition. Ventilation of sub-oxic waters below the sill from eddy activity has been documented by Astor et al 2003. The basin is also subject to a mid-year secondary upwelling typically occurring in June-August induced by intensification of the Caribbean Current (see Rueda-Roa et al 2018). Stronger El Niño could be related to enhanced secondary upwelling but not necessarily to intensification of the primary upwelling during January-April.

\begin{revcomment}
Figure B2: Please clarify how this figure is different from Figure 6. Both figures have nitrate as predictor but the curves are different. It is not clear from the caption why this is the case. The same with AMO. Also, note that Trichodesmium belongs to cyanobacteria and is misclassified here (not in Figure 6).
\end{revcomment}
\begin{revresponse}
    We forgot to clarify this in the figure caption. Figure C2 and C3 (in the update manuscript, previously these were B2 and B3) show the gradient forest analysis performed without any time lags in the predictor variables, whereas Figure 6 in the main text includes optimized time lags for climate and meteorological variables (see Table C1). This comparison was included to demonstrate the effect of incorporating time lags on predictor rankings and response curves, as the gradient forest algorithm showed high sensitivity to this methodological choice. Notably, even without time lags, AMO and MEI v.2 rank relatively high among predictors, supporting the robustness of our finding that climate indices are important predictors of community change.
    
    The differences in the cumulative importance curves for nitrate (and other variables without time lags) between Figures 6 and C2 arise from two sources: (1) the conditional permutation procedure, which accounts for correlations among predictors and can lead to different importance attributions when the predictor set changes (i.e., when lagged vs. non-lagged variables are used), and (2) to a smaller part due to the stochastic nature of the random forest models underlying the gradient forest algorithm. The AMO curves differ more substantially because Figure 6 uses a 2-month lag while Figure C2 uses no lag.
    
    We have corrected the figure caption to explicitly state that these supplementary figures show results without time lags. We have also corrected the classification of \textit{Trichodesmium}, which was erroneously colored as "other" rather than a cyanobacterium in Figure C2. We thank the reviewer for catching this error.

\begin{generalcomment}
	The paper describes analysis of a long time series of phytoplankton cell counts collected alongside environmental variables in the Cariaco Basin time series site, as well as larger climatic indices. The work recapitulates early analysis of trends in phytoplankton dynamics associated with environmental variables; previous work determined phytoplankton classes according to HPLC pigment concentrations and examined environmental data from water samples collected at the CARIACO Ocean Time Series site. The current study built upon this work and analyzed genus-level phytoplankton data using cell counts and incorporated climate indices (AMO and ENSO signals). The present work uses gradient forest analysis to identify thresholds in environmental variables to better understand drivers of phytoplankton community diversity and abundances. While there are some limitations of this approach (i.e., with monthly data, there is the potential of time-aliasing and a lack of resolution with which to identify thresholds), the long-time series helps to overcome some of the limitations in ability to detect changes that correspond to environmental thresholds. There are few long-term data sets of this type, which make the study valuable for exploring relationships between environmental factors and biological production over time. At a time when climate change is threatening ecosystems worldwide, such data and their analyses are critical to understand and predict the impacts of climate shifts.

\begin{revcomment}\label{comment:first-rev2}
	There are several spots that could benefit from tighter synthesis of ideas and greater clarity in presentation, mainly in the Results section, where findings were sometimes presented as stand-alone statements rather than woven together into a cogent story or line of thinking. The authors did a nice job articulating how the work built upon previous analyses and explained some of the limitations of the work; however, I do think they missed an opportunity to discuss how gaps in data in the last few years of the time series might affect their conclusions. The biggest question I have about this study is how missing data affect the conclusions drawn by the authors. How were missing data in 2004, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017 addressed in the cluster analyses? The crux of the work lies in the fact that there is a perceived oscillation in phytoplankton communities between two thresholds (2004 and 2014). Yet, there are only 3 years post-2014, and two of them are characterized by large data gaps (in 2015 there are $>$ 4 months of missing data, while in 2014 there are $>$ 2 but $<$ 4 months of missing data). No data from 2016 or 2017 are shown at all in Figure 2. The authors did not discuss this in the section on limitations in the Discussion, which I found surprising; how susceptible to these missing data are their conclusions? I think it would help to identify the particular months of missing data in year where there were significant gaps; otherwise, averaging values when seasonal highs or lows are absent risks skewing the results, which the authors note in the text in at least one section. Aside from a brief comment about missing chlorophyll data in 2013 (lines 351-352), there wasn’t much discussion about the importance of missing data.
\end{revcomment}
\begin{revresponse}
    We thank the reviewer for raising this important point. We have expanded our discussion of missing data and added a dedicated subsection (Section~2.4.3) clarifying how different analyses handle data gaps.
    
    For annually aggregated analyses (z-scores in Figure~\ref{fig:zscore}, hierarchical clustering in Figure~\ref{fig:clustering}a, species turnover in Figure~\ref{fig:clustering}b, and annual means in Figure~\ref{fig:divts}), we excluded years with fewer than six monthly observations (1995, 2016, and 2017). The other years also include some missing monthly data (see \autoref{comment:phyto-coverage} for a more detailed discussion of this), yet our hierarchical clustering uses presence-absence data, which is relatively robust to missing months because a genus need only be detected once within a year to be recorded as present. Other parts of our analysis (NMDS ordination, density distributions, and gradient forest), were performed with the original monthly resolution and include all available observations. We have now additionally conducted sensitivity analyses using `core months' consistently sampled across 2014-2017 to verify that conclusions of a return to the earlier regime were not artifacts of uneven sampling of seasonal outliers.
    
    Regarding the post-2014 period: although 2014 and 2015 have gaps, both years retain observations from both upwelling and rainy seasons, reducing the risk of seasonal bias. To further assess the robustness of our conclusions, we compared monthly observations across three periods (Early Cluster~1: 1996-2004; Cluster~2: 2005-2013; Late Cluster~1: 2014-2017) using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests (see Table~\ref{tab:sup:period_comparison}). For key variables including SST, salinity, chlorophyll~$a$, and several functional groups, Early~C1 and Cluster~2 differ significantly, and Cluster~2 and Late~C1 differ significantly, while Early~C1 and Late~C1 do not, a pattern consistent with partial recovery to pre-2005 conditions. Additionally, independent sampling near Margarita Island in the Cariaco Basin from 2002-2018 (\cite{gomez_gaspar_variacion_2025}) show a reduction following 2004 and a return to elevated surface chlorophyll during 2014-2017, corroborating a potential recovery.
    
    We have added discussion of these points to Section~4.3 (Limitations).
\end{revresponse}

\begin{revcomment} \label{comment:ChlMax}
	In a similar vein, I found it a little hard to follow how they were grouping the data in some sections of the manuscript. In some analysis, they aggregated data by year (including 12 months of data into a yearly average), while in other analyses, report seasonal values (e.g., upwelling vs. downwelling seasons). But even monthly-averaged data is subject to time-aliasing; they might consider a discussion on the implications and impacts of time averaging. The same can be said for depth-averaging; I would have liked to have seen data on mixed layer depth and solar insolation to better understand the implications of data interpolation or the conclusions that the chlorophyll maximum was deeper in some years than others.
\end{revcomment}

\begin{revresponse}
    We have added a paragraph to Section~2.4 (\lineref{R:ClarifyAggregation}) that clearly summarizes which part of our analysis use annual aggregation versus monthly resolution, and all use depth integration over 0-100~m, except for the variables shown across four depth intervals in Figure~\ref{fig:divts}. We hope this clarifies the data grouping throughout the manuscript.
    
    Regarding time averaging and aliasing: We agree that the monthly resolution might miss crucial short term variablitity. Our in-situ data represents discrete monthly samples, not averages derived from higher-frequency measurements. Only the climate reanalysis data (ERA5) represent monthly averages. Annual aggregation was applied selectively to emphasize interannual trends, while monthly-resolution analyses (NMDS, gradient forest) preserve seasonal signals. Figure~\ref{fig:divts} was included specifically to show both depth-resolved and seasonal patterns, complementing the 100m-depth-integrated analyses elsewhere.
    
    Regarding mixed layer depth and chlorophyll maximum dynamics: Our references to a deeper chlorophyll maximum during stratified periods are based on previous research (\cite{lorenzoni_characterization_2015, pinckney_phytoplankton_2015}). Our depth-resolved data in Figure~\ref{fig:divts} are consistent with these earlier findings. Other parts of our analysis focuse on fully depth-integrated properties to capture large-scale community changes, rather than on the vertical structure of the community. Mixed layer depth in the Cariaco Basin is consistently shallow ($<$35~m; \cite{muller-karger_scientific_2019}) and the 21$^{\circ}$C isotherm depth is more commonly used as a proxy for upwelling intensity in this system. Rergarding euphotic zone depth data, there are some reported values, e.g. \cite{pinckney_phytoplankton_2015} document a significant deepening of the euphotic zone, with the average depth (defined as 0.1\% PAR) increasing from 61±18 m (1996–2000) to 75±13 m (2006–2010). We have added a sentence in \lineref{R2:C14} to mention this. 
\end{revresponse}

\begin{revcomment} 
	Overall, I think the work merits publication; I would just like to see more careful discussion of the limitations imposed by gaps in data as well as implications of broad grouping (i.e., ‘nanoflagellates’) vs. genus-level data on diversity metrics, and some work to synthesize and clarify sections of the text that feel a bit confusing to the reader.
\end{revcomment}
\begin{revresponse}
    We thank the reviewer for these suggestions. As detailed in our responses above, we have added discussion of data gaps and their implications to Section~2.4.3 and Section~4.3, and clarified the data aggregation approaches in Section~2.4.
    
    Regarding the `nanoflagellates' grouping: this broad category appears only in the z-score analysis (Figure~\ref{fig:zscore}), where it illustrates interannual trends in functional group biomass. Nanoflagellate counts were reported as such in the original data and were not identified to finer taxonomic levels. Thus, nanoflagellates were excluded from all diversity metric calculations which are based exclusively on genus-level identifications. We have added clarifying text to ensure this distinction is clear to readers (see \lineref{R2:C25}).
    
    We have also revised sections of the Results to improve synthesis and flow, as suggested.
\end{revresponse}


\begin{revcomment}
	Abstract
    
    The statement about phytoplankton diversity could be better articulated here; it isn’t clear what the implications of a lack of change in diversity over a part of the data set are. Perhaps just add a clause indicating what this signifies. Otherwise, it feels like a result out of place.
\end{revcomment}
\begin{revresponse}
	We have reformulated that sentence to highlight the finding, that community evenness was higher during cluster 2. Indeed, we have no clear hypothesis or result to explain the lack of change in diversity, however the change in evenness is in line with the common understanding of the link between upwelling, productivity and community evenness.
\end{revresponse}

\begin{revcomment}
	Abstract (continued)
    
    This sentence would benefit from a bit of elaboration: “…found the AMO index was the strongest predictor” – please indicate what the predictor is.
\end{revcomment}
\begin{revresponse}
	We have reformulated the sentence to clearly state that it is a predictor of changes in the phytoplankton community composition.
\end{revresponse}

\begin{revcomment}
	Abstract (continued)
    
    The conclusion that the pattern is cyclic depends on whether the data from 2014 onward are representative of the full calendar year (despite missing data); the relationship with the AMO is interesting regardless of cyclicity
\end{revcomment}
\begin{revresponse}
    We agree that the interpretation of cyclicity depends on the representativeness of the post-2014 data. As detailed in our response to the previous comment, our sensitivity analyses and statistical comparisons (Table~\ref{tab:sup:period_comparison}) provide support to this finding, as does independent evidence from \cite{gomez_gaspar_variacion_2025}. 
    We hope that our original manuscript already used tempered language, but we have reviewed the abstract and discussion to ensure this caution is consistently conveyed. We agree that the AMO relationship is a robust finding independent of the cyclicity question.
\end{revresponse}


\begin{revcomment}
	Introduction
    
    It would be great to include a little more explanation about the AMO and AMO anomaly to better understand its impact on water column characteristics and phytoplankton populations; it ends up being a major part of the story.
\end{revcomment}
\begin{revresponse}
	We have included a clearer discussion of the current knowledge of the effect of AMO phases on the Caribbean Sea and the Cariaco Basin to clarify this (see \lineref{R2:C7}).

    \begin{changes}
        The oscillations of the AMO index are strongly correlated with temperature indices in the Caribbean Sea, where a negative phase is generally correlated with warmer and drier conditions and a positive phase with colder and wetter conditions (Stephenson et al. 2014). A negative AMO phase has also been linked to a southward shift in the ITCZ (Knight et al. 2006). Such a southward shift of the ITCZ is correlated with increased wind-driven upwelling in the Cariaco Basin (Taylor et al. 2012). 
    \end{changes}
\end{revresponse}


\begin{revcomment}
	Introduction (continued)
    
    The authors state that “Data from 2014 to 2017, the final years of the CARIACO (Carbon Retention In A Colored Ocean) timeseries, indicated a return to strong upwelling intensities and high numbers of diatoms and dinoflagellates (Muller-Karger, Astor, Benitez-Nelson, Buck, et al., 2019).” It would be nice to specifically state the hypothesis that larger climatic factors influence the shift to stronger upwelling and thus, increased numbers of diatoms and dinoflagellates; it would also be great to indicate that the former data came from HPLC pigment analysis so that the reader is clear on how the present work is different from that already done. Examining the data at the class level (i.e., through pigment analysis by HPLC) vs. at the genus level could produce a different understanding of responses to environmental variables.
    
\end{revcomment}
\begin{revresponse}
	We have reformulated that section and included both the hypothesis and specific references to which data is the foundation for Muller-Karger et al.'s suggestion that there was a return to strong upwelling intensities and the previous phytoplankton community. To our knowledge, their claim makes reference to aggregated microscopy cell counts of Diatoms and Dinoflagellates, and not HPLC data. We have added this clarification to the paragraph (see \lineref{R2:C8:1}).
    We have also added a sentence to clearly state our hypothesis that these changes were driven by large-scale climatic factors, thank you for pointing this out.
    We have also added to our discussion a paragraph on the fact that microscopy data and pigment data may yield different insights into community responses (see \lineref{R2:C8:2}).
    
\end{revresponse}

\begin{revcomment}
	Introduction (continued)
    
    Line 119: Please state what observed changes are being discussed here; it would help orient the reader to the purpose of this paragraph
\end{revcomment}
\begin{revresponse}
	We have added the specific trends that Taylor et al. 2012 is presenting, which hopefully clarifies this (see \lineref{R2:C9}).
    In this paragraph, we aim to highlight the novel aspect of our study, that we analyze the trends not as unidirectional, and using more data found evidence for a potential cyclic or oscillatory pattern.

	Methods

    Section 2.3 would benefit from some re-working. The authors explain that they examined meteorological data (wind, precipitation, evaporation) as well as climate indices, but do not explain in what ways the data were used. The second paragraph in this section introduces the idea of exploring two climatic indices, but then only describes one, with the second presented in the following paragraph. These could be consolidated for greater clarity.
\end{revcomment}

	We have consolidated the last two paragraphs of this section, and add a sentence to clarify for which part of our analysis these values were used  (see \lineref{R2:C10}).

\begin{revcomment}\label{comment:phyto-coverage}
	Methods (continued)

    It would be helpful to know which months constituted missing data; there are missing data and substantial gaps for each of the years 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017, as well as 2004 (for phytoplankton data). How important were the missing data in 2004 or these latter years in driving a perceived shift in species distribution/diversity?
\end{revcomment}
\begin{revresponse}
	We thank the reviewer for raising this important point about data gaps. For phytoplankton data, a complete list of missing months is given here:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item 1995: January-October (10 months; time series began in November)
        \item 1997: August (1 month)
        \item 1998: April, May, November (3 months)
        \item 2000: August, September (2 months)
        \item 2002: September (1 month)
        \item 2003: October, December (2 months)
        \item 2004: January, April, May (3 months, all within upwelling season)
        \item 2005: September, November (2 months)
        \item 2007: January, November (2 months)
        \item 2010: July (1 month)
        \item 2011: December (1 month)
        \item 2012: June (1 month)
        \item 2013: January, February (2 months, both within upwelling season)
        \item 2014: March, July, August (3 months)
        \item 2015: January, May, June, October (4 months)
        \item 2016: March, April, June-August, October, November (7 months)
        \item 2017: February-December (11 months; only January sampled)
    \end{itemize}

    We acknowledge that these gaps, particularly the missing upwelling-season months in 2004 and 2013, could have influenced the detected shift timing. To assess whether sampling gaps drove the observed patterns, we conducted a sensitivity analysis restricting data to months consistently sampled across 2014–2017, which confirmed that clustering patterns remained consistent [see Supplementary Material, Section/Figure SX - PLACEHOLDER].
    
    Additionally, our hierarchical clustering used binary (presence-absence) data aggregated annually, an approach relatively robust to missing observations compared to abundance-based metrics. While these considerations provide reasonable certainty that missing data do not fundamentally skew our results and interpretation, we recognize that findings from the later years (2014–2017) should be interpreted with care. We have added a paragraph to the Discussion addressing the limitations imposed by data gaps (see \lineref{R2:missing-discussion}).
\end{revresponse}

\begin{revcomment}
	Methods (continued)

    Lines 195 – 198: The authors refer to easterly winds in referencing zonal winds, but then say they extracted the eastward component of the wind – easterly vs. eastward generally refer to different directions (easterly = from the east, eastward = toward the east). The authors should clarify which is correct and then adjust the language to use similar terms for wind direction. It is also a bit unclear whether they only used the easterly/eastward component of the 10 m winds, whether they used the absolute value of wind speed at 10 m height, or whether they accounted for wind direction in their analyses.
\end{revcomment}
\begin{revresponse}
	We thank the reviewer for pointing out this confusing terminology. The ERA5 variable u10 is defined as the eastward component of wind speed, meaning positive values indicate wind blowing toward the east and negative values indicate wind blowing toward the west (i.e., easterly winds). Since upwelling in the Cariaco Basin is driven by easterly trade winds, we used the negative of u10 so that positive values in our analysis correspond to stronger easterly winds. We have revised the methods text to clarify this (see \lineref{R2:C12}).

    Section 2.3.1: To clarify the assumptions that are made in calculating depth profiles, it would be good to indicate the depth frequency of interpolated values – ie, depth integration was achieved by summing interpolated values at what depth intervals? In addition, it would be nice to report or show the mixed layer depth in relation to the selected depth intervals/bins to better understand influences on subsurface chl maxima. If PAR data were not collected, the data aren’t available to discuss; however, it would be good to acknowledge the influence that the euphotic zone depth has on the depth distribution of phytoplankton.
\end{revcomment}

\begin{revresponse}
	We thank the reviewer for these suggestions regarding vertical structure and depth integration methods.
	
	We have already mentioned the discrete depth intervals at which CARIACO data were sampled at in Section 2.2, but now additionally added that information  (1, 7, 15, 25, 35, 55, 75, and 100 m) to Section 2.3.1. Depth integration was achieved by interpolating to a meter-resolution between these standard depths using the ``unesco'' algorithm from the R ``oce'' package, then summing across the specified depth intervals. We hope this answers the reviewers questions.
	
	Regarding mixed layer depth: in the tropical coastal ecosystem of the Cariaco Basin, mixed layer depth is consistently shallow ($<$\qty{35}{\meter}; \cite{muller-karger_scientific_2019}) and shows high variability. For this reason, the 21°C isotherm depth, which we include in our analysis, is more commonly used as a proxy for upwelling intensity in this system (e.g. \cite{astor_seasonal_2003, lorenzoni_bio-optical_2011, pinckney_phytoplankton_2015}).
	
	We acknowledge that euphotic zone depth influences phytoplankton vertical distribution. Unfortunately, PAR data were not collected during the time series. Please see \autoref{comment:ChlMax} for additional discussion. Further investigation is out of the scope of our study. We have added an acknowledgment of this limitation to the discussion (see \lineref{R2:C14}).

	Methods (continued)

    Section 2.4 – Data analysis:
    The authors note that data from 1995, 2016, and 2017 were excluded due to missing data, with more than 6 months of data missing (i.e., 50\% of each year). The missing data make it difficult to be confident in the cyclical nature of change reported in the manuscript. Were there also missing data for phytoplankton cell counts in these years? In Lines 334-335, the authors note that “Although data are sparse, nutrients and biological variables show a strong increase from 2014”
\end{revcomment}
\begin{revresponse}
    Yes, phytoplankton cell count data were also incomplete for these years. As detailed in our response to your \autoref{comment:phyto-coverage}, wheree provide a complete list of missing months for phytoplankton data. Years with fewer than six monthly observations, 1995 ($n=2$), 2016 ($n=5$), and 2017 ($n=1$), were excluded from annually aggregated analyses for this reason (Section~2.4, \lineref{R1:C12:start}[R1:C12:end]).
    
    Regarding the sentence at \lineref{R2:C15:sparse}[R2:C15:sparse:end]: we acknowledge this could be clearer, and have revised it to explicitly state which data are sparse and why we consider the cyclic interpretation robust:
    \begin{changes}
        Although data are sparse after 2013, with 2016 and 2017 excluded from annual analyses due to insufficient monthly coverage, the available observations from 2014 and 2015, which include both upwelling and rainy season months, show a strong increase in nutrients and biological variables, coinciding with a return to negative anomalies in the AMO index and to more upwelling-favorable conditions.
    \end{changes}
    
    As previously mentioned this cyclic pattern was proposed by \cite{muller-karger_scientific_2019}. Our hypothesis of the cyclic pattern rests on three lines of evidence detailed in our response to your ~\autoref{comment:first-rev2}: (1) sensitivity analyses using `core months' consistently sampled across 2014-2017; (2) statistical comparisons showing Late Cluster~1 does not differ significantly from Early Cluster~1 while both differ from Cluster~2 (Table~\ref{tab:sup:period_comparison}); and (3) independent corroboration from \cite{gomez_gaspar_variacion_2025}. 
    Clearly though, the cyclic pattern can only be confirmed by more and better data coverage, which we unfortunately lack due to the termination of the CARIACO time series.

\begin{revcomment}
	Methods (continued)

    Lines 241-243: This topic sentence would benefit from re-working to improve clarity. Is it correct that the authors took all cell counts from the different depths sampled for a given month, created interpolated values, averaged them over depth to get a single representative value for a taxon for that month, did this for each month, and then created an average that included all months of the year? The way it is phrased leaves a little uncertainty on exactly where the averaging happened.
\end{revcomment}
\begin{revresponse}
    We thank the reviewer for requesting this clarification. The reviewer's understanding is largely correct. The procedure is as follows:
    \begin{enumerate}
        %NOTE: need to double check my actual interpolation algorithm!
        \item Depth-discrete cell counts (at 1, 7, 15, 25, 35, 55, 75, and 100~m) were interpolated to 1~m resolution and integrated (summed) over the upper 100~m to obtain a single depth-integrated value per taxon per month.
        \item For each month, depth-integrated counts of all taxa belonging to a functional group were summed to obtain total cell counts per functional group.
        \item These monthly functional group totals were then averaged across all months within a year to obtain annual mean cell counts per functional group.
    \end{enumerate}
    We have revised the sentence at \lineref{R2:C16} to clarify this procedure:
    \begin{changes}
        To calculate integrated cell counts of phytoplankton per functional group for each year, we first interpolated depth-discrete measurements and integrated them over the upper 100~m for each taxon identified to species or genus level. We then summed these depth-integrated counts by functional group for each month, and finally averaged these monthly totals across all months of the year.

This correction did not qualitatively affect our results or conclusions.

\begin{revresponse}
    We thank the reviewer for this feedback. We have revised the Results section to improve synthesis, adding transitional sentences that connect individual observations to the broader narrative and highlight how findings relate to one another.

    Figure 2: I think the figure would be more effective if the color spectrum was reversed; usually, the convention is that high values are red tones, while low values are blues – the first time I looked at this plot, I assumed that the reds were positive anomalies rather than negative ones.
\end{revcomment}
\begin{revresponse}
    We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. Upon reflection, we agree that following the conventional color scheme (red for positive anomalies, blue for negative) improves readability and avoids potential confusion. We have revised Figure~\ref{fig:zscore} accordingly.

\begin{revcomment}

    Line 325: The authors refer to ‘periods’ of stronger upwelling, but they are discussing annual data (i.e., average of monthly values) – so, the unit of consideration would be ‘years’ of strong upwelling/anomalies, based on the data being discussed. If they mean to say that nitrate/phosphate tend to be elevated under periods of stronger upwelling (i.e., event-scale), it would be helpful to specify this – that is, that strong upwelling periods in a given year may result in positive nitrate/phosphate anomalies in the yearly average.
\end{revcomment}
\begin{revresponse}
    We have revised this sentence (\lineref{R2:C20}) to clarify that we are discussing annual means that reflect the influence of upwelling events within each year:
    \begin{changes}
        Nitrate and phosphate anomalies tended to be higher during years characterized by stronger upwelling events, as intensified upwelling within a given year elevates the annual mean concentrations.
    \end{changes}

    Lines 337-341: The last part of this paragraph would benefit from additional clarity.
\end{revcomment}
\begin{revresponse}
    We have revised this paragraph (\lineref{R2:C21:start}[R2:C21:end]) to improve clarity:
    \begin{changes}
        The annual means of diversity metrics do not follow this general pattern. Shannon diversity z-scores were reduced between 1998 and 2007, then elevated between 2007 and 2013, during a period when chlorophyll~\textit{a} and cell counts were diminished. This inverse relationship between diversity and biomass is consistent with expectations for upwelling systems, where strong upwelling favors dominance by fewer taxa. However, in 1996 and 1997, positive anomalies in cell counts, chlorophyll~\textit{a}, and diversity metrics coincided, suggesting that additional factors influenced community structure during the early years of the time series.
    \end{changes}
\end{revresponse}

\begin{revcomment}
	Results (continued)

    In the paragraph discussing genus diversity (lines 360 – 372), the idea that the transition from high to low to high diversity index values represents a ‘recovery’ could use some justification; this assumes that low diversity represents an impairment, and the change back to a higher diversity regime represents a return to better conditions. The last two lines of this paragraph could be improved for clarity; lines 369 – 371 are a little confusing. The middle of the paragraph discusses annual values, but this line calls out diversity “throughout 2000”, with the first and last parts of the paragraph discussing differences between upwelling and downwelling periods. Overall, it was a little hard to follow the discussion about intra- vs. inter-annual patterns as presented. It would help if the purpose of the analyses was described first – i.e., to distinguish between upwelling vs. downwelling seasons in terms of genus diversity – and then place these observations into the larger context of inter-annual variability.
\end{revcomment}
\begin{revresponse}
    We thank the reviewer for these suggestions. We have restructured this paragraph (\lineref{R2:C22:start}[R2:C22:end]) to first state the purpose of the analysis, then clearly distinguish between seasonal and interannual patterns. We removed the term `recovery,' which implied a value judgment about diversity states. We also clarified the temporal references to avoid confusion between intra- and interannual scales.

\begin{revcomment}\label{comment:clustering-dominance}
	Results (continued)

    Section 3.2:
    Line 395 – If the data were divided into 2 clusters, why did the authors highlight the “later part” of cluster 1? Given the fact that the first cluster was dominated by Thalassiosira, which transitioned to Emiliania (note that Emiliania is misspelled in the manuscript) and the second cluster is dominated by Pseudo-nitzschia followed by Emiliania, it would seem that what they are describing is less of a distinct 2-cluster situation and more of a transition.
\end{revcomment}
\begin{revresponse}
    We thank the reviewer for this observation. The hierarchical clustering was performed using the binary Jaccard distance matrix, which considers only presence-absence of genera and is insensitive to relative abundances. Under this metric, the years 1996-2004 and 2014-2016 form a single cluster based on shared taxonomic composition.
    
    We included the dominant genera separately to provide additional ecological context, as dominance patterns reflect a different aspect of community structure than presence-absence similarity. The shift in dominant taxa from \textit{Thalassiosira} (early Cluster~1) to \textit{Pseudo-nitzschia}/\textit{Emiliania} (Cluster~2) to \textit{Emiliania}/\textit{Thalassiosira} (late Cluster~1) does suggest that the community did transition rather than return. However, the clustering analysis indicates that despite these shifts in dominance, the overall taxonomic pool present in late Cluster~1 more closely resembles early Cluster~1 than Cluster~2. We have added a clarifying sentence to the text to distinguish these complementary perspectives (\lineref{R2:C23}).
    
    We have also corrected the spelling of \textit{Emiliania} throughout the manuscript and figures.

    Line 456 – Do the authors mean “confounding” or corresponding effects? The context seems better suited for “corresponding”
\end{revcomment}
\begin{revresponse}
	We have corrected the phrase to use the word "corresponding", since this is what we meant to say.

    Line 460 – It would be helpful to put the reduction in cell counts into context – 5 times lower? 10 times?
\end{revcomment}
\begin{revresponse}
	We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. To provide concrete context, we quantified the reduction in cell counts by comparing the average abundances of major functional groups during the period following the shift (2005–2013) against the preceding baseline period (1996–2004).

    This comparison reveals dramatic declines: chlorophyll a concentrations decreased 1.6-fold, diatoms and dinoflagellates were 12.5-fold and 7.2-fold lower, respectively, while cyanobacteria decreased 19.3-fold. We have updated the text to explicitly state these quantitative reductions, defining the comparison periods by year to clearly illustrate the magnitude of the shift before introducing the cluster analysis  (see \lineref{R2:C26}).
\end{revresponse}


\begin{revcomment}
	Discussion (continued)

    Lines 468-470 – Did the phytoplankton community return to previous composition after 2014? As stated above, the dominant genera from 2014 – 2017 included Emiliania, Thalassionema, and Thalassiosira (present throughout the time series); it seems as though the dominant species showed more of a transition than stepped differences, with the early period having Pseudo-nitzschia and Thalassiosira as dominants, transitioning to Emiliania and Thalassiosira. If the rest of the community is what is driving the conclusion that taxonomic shifts between the clusters, it would be nice to elaborate a bit on this here.
\end{revcomment}
\begin{revresponse}
    As noted in our response to the related comment above (\autoref{comment:clustering-dominance}), our conclusion of a return to previous conditions is based on presence-absence similarity (binary Jaccard distance), not shifts in dominant taxa. While the identity of dominant genera differed among periods, the clustering indicates that the overall taxonomic pool present in 2014-2016 more closely resembles 1996-2004 than the intermediate period. We have added clarifying text to the Discussion (\lineref{R2:C24}) to make this distinction explicit.
\end{revresponse}


\begin{revcomment}
	Discussion (continued)

    Line 476 - What is the size limit for detection of cells in this analysis? Depending on the magnification used, cells as small as 2-3 um could be detected. Some diatoms are very small, so it may not be the case that a shift to smaller cells did not include diatoms (line 477; I would suggest specifying ‘large’ diatoms here).
\end{revcomment}
\begin{revresponse}
	The magnification used in identifying cells was 100x according to the Methods Handbook of the CARIACO time series. We stated in our discussion, that only microphytoplankton (cells > 20 µm) were identified. To make this clearer in our manuscript, we have added a sentence to the methods section to mention the magnification and size limit.
    
    That small diatoms may have gone undetected is a valid point and we have added the specification of \textit{large} diatoms in the sentence (\lineref{R2:C28}).

    Line 499 – It would be helpful to know the mixed layer depth to understand the significance of 55 m depth
\end{revcomment}

\begin{revresponse}
    The 55~m depth threshold originates from \cite{pinckney_phytoplankton_2015} and likely reflects constraints of the depth-resolved data sources, rather than the mixed layer depth. 
    Please see \autoref{comment:ChlMax} for a more detailed discussion of the euphotic zone and mixed layer depth.
    We have added clarifying text to the Discussion noting this distinction and the data limitations (see \lineref{R2:C14}).
\end{revresponse}

\begin{revcomment}
	Discussion (continued)

    Line 509 – When nanoflagellates are present at increased numbers in the community, this would influence richness estimates, since the various genera encompassed by this polyphyletic group are not necessarily captured accurately; it would be helpful for the authors to discuss how a broad grouping might influence estimates of genus richness and thus the clusters and patterns observed in the data. Lines 512 – 516 would benefit from consideration of the effect of a grouping of nanoflagellate taxa on evenness metrics.
\end{revcomment}
\begin{revresponse}
    We thank the reviewer for raising this concern. The wording in our Methods section was unclear. Nanoflagellate counts were included only in the z-score analysis of functional group biomass (Figure~\ref{fig:zscore}), where they illustrate interannual trends. However, because nanoflagellates were not identified to genus level in the original data, they were excluded from all diversity metric calculations (genus richness, Shannon index, Pielou's evenness) and from the hierarchical clustering analysis, which are based exclusively on genus-level community data. In Section~4.3 (see \lineref{R2:C31}, we discuss the strong limitation the microscopy data imposes, the size detection limit skews our richness estimates of communities dominated by smaller phytoplankton.

            Our understanding on phytoplankton diversity has largely been progressing since the publication of Hutchinson on the paradox of the plankton. In this paper, we summarise some major steps in phytoplankton ecology in the context of mechanisms underlying phytoplankton diversity. Here, we provide a framework for phytoplankton community assembly and an overview of measures on taxonomic and functional diversity. We show how ecological theories on species competition together with modelling approaches and laboratory experiments helped understand species coexistence and maintenance of diversity in phytoplankton. The non-equilibrium nature of phytoplankton and the role of disturbances in shaping diversity are also discussed. Furthermore, we discuss the role of water body size, productivity of habitats and temperature on phytoplankton species richness, and how diversity may affect the functioning of lake ecosystems. At last, we give an insight into molecular tools that have emerged in the last decades and argue how it has broadened our perspective on microbial diversity. Besides historical backgrounds, some critical comments have also been made.},

    abstract = {Efﬁciency of the biological pump of carbon to the deep ocean depends largely on biologically mediated export of carbon from the surface ocean and its remineralization with depth. Global satellite studies have primarily focused on chlorophyll concentration and net primary production (NPP) to understand the role of phytoplankton in these processes. Recent satellite retrievals of phytoplankton composition now allow for the size of phytoplankton cells to be considered. Here we improve understanding of phytoplankton size structure impacts on particle export, remineralization, and transfer. A global compilation of particulate organic carbon (POC) ﬂux estimated from sediment traps and 234Th are utilized. Annual climatologies of NPP, percent microplankton, and POC ﬂux at four time series locations and within biogeochemical provinces are constructed. Parameters that characterize POC ﬂux versus depth (export ﬂux ratio, labile fraction, and remineralization length scale) are ﬁt for time series locations, biogeochemical provinces, and times of the year dominated by small and large phytoplankton cells where phytoplankton cell size show enough dynamic range over the annual cycle. Considering all data together, our ﬁndings support the idea of high export ﬂux but low transfer efﬁciency in productive regions and vice versa for oligotrophic regions. However, when parsing by dominant size class, we ﬁnd periods dominated by small cells to have both greater export ﬂux efﬁciency and lower transfer efﬁciency than periods when large cells comprise a greater proportion of the phytoplankton community.},
